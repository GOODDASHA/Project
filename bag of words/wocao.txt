2. 

On the evening of April 20, 2010, a blowout, explosions, and fire occurred aboard 

the MODU DEEPWATER HORIZON (sometimes  referred  to  as  the  “HORIZON”)  as it was in 

the process of temporarily abandoning a well, known as Macondo, it had drilled on the Outer 

Continental Shelf off the coast of Louisiana.   

3. 

Eleven  men  died  tragically  in  the  incident:    Jason  Anderson,  Dewey  Revette, 

Aaron  (Dale)  Burkeen,  Donald  Clark,  Stephen  Curtis,  Roy  (Wyatt)  Kemp,  Karl  Kleppinger, 

Shane Roshto, Adam Weise, Keith Blair Manuel, and Gordon Jones.   At least seventeen others 

were injured.  The survivors evacuated to the M/V DAMON BANKSTON, a supply vessel that 

was near the HORIZON when the explosions occurred. 

4. 

The  explosions  and/or  fire  should  have  triggered  the  automatic  function  on  the 

HORIZON’s   BOP,  but  that  function  either  failed  to  activate  the  BOP  or  the  BOP  otherwise 

failed  to  shut  in  the  well.    Subsequent  attempts  to  operate  the  BOP  with  remotely  operated 

vehicles also failed to stop the blowout. 

5. 

Several vessels responded to the distress calls and attempted to extinguish the fire 

with  their  monitors  (water  canon).    Despite  these  efforts,  the  HORIZON  burned  continuously 

until mid-morning on April 22, when it capsized and sank into the Gulf of Mexico.   

6. 

As the rig descended, the marine riser—the approximately 5,000 feet of pipe that 

connected the rig to the BOP3—collapsed and broke.  Millions of gallons of oil discharged into 

the Gulf of Mexico over the next 87 days.  

                                                                                                                                                             
number  is  the  “pdf”  page  number  (i.e.,  page  “1”  is the very first page of the exhibit), which may be different from 
the page number appearing on the exhibit.

7. 

After  multiple  unsuccessful  attempts,  the  well  was  finally  capped  and  the 

discharge halted on July 15, 2010.  In mid-September, a relief well intercepted the Macondo well 

and permanently sealed it with cement.   

8. 

It was not long after the initial explosions that the first lawsuits were filed.  Since 

that  time,  approximately  3,000  cases,  with  over  100,000  named  claimants,  have  been  filed  in 

federal and state courts across the nation.  These suits asserted a wide array of claims including 

wrongful death and personal injury due to the explosion and fire, post-incident personal injury 

resulting from exposure to oil and/or the chemical dispersants used during the oil spill response, 

damage to property or natural resources, and economic losses resulting from the oil spill.   

9. 

On August 10, 2010, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation 

transferred most4 federal cases to this Court as Multidistrict Litigation no. 2179 (“MDL  2179”).5   

10. 

This Court adopted a phased trial proceeding that ultimately focused on two cases 
within MDL 2179: In re Triton Asset Leasing GmbH, et al. (Civ. A. No. 10-2771) and United 
States v. BP Exploration & Production Inc., et al. (Civ. A. No. 10-4536).6  Both cases are before 

the Court for all purposes,7 and both are proceedings in admiralty under 28 U.S.C. § 1333(1) and 

Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  9(h).    Consequently,  these  cases  may  be  tried  by  this  Court 

without a jury. 

11. 

In re Triton Asset Leasing GmbH  is  a  limitation  action  filed  by  several  of  the 
Transocean  entities  pursuant  to  46  U.S.C.  §  30501,  et  seq.,  commonly  referred  to  as  the 

Shipowner’s   Limitation   of   Liability   Act.    Thousands  of  claims  were  filed  in  that  action.  

                                                 
pending before the Southern District of Texas.  BP p.l.c. Sec. Litig., 734 F. Supp. 2d 1376 (J.P.M.L. 2010).   

4 Shareholder derivative suits and other securities-related cases were placed into a separate MDL, number 2185, 
5 In re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig “Deepwater  Horizon”  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  on  April  20,  2010, 731 F. Supp. 2d 
6 See Case Management Orders 3 and 4, Rec. Docs. 4083, 6592. 
7 This is in contrast to cases that were transferred to this Court pursuant to the MDL statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1407, 

1352 (J.P.M.L. 2010).   

which are here for pretrial purposes only.   

 

7 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 8 of 153

Pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  14(c),  the  Transocean  entities  impleaded  other 

parties  who  it  alleged  were  partially  or  wholly  liable.    The  Rule  14(c)  parties  then 

counterclaimed against Transocean and crossclaimed against one another.  Although Transocean 

is  technically  the  “plaintiff”  or  “petitioner”  in  a limitation action, for simplicity the Court will 

sometimes refer to it and the impleaded 14(c) parties as “Defendants.”    Likewise, claimants in 

the limitation proceeding who typically would occupy the position of plaintiffs will be referred to 

as “Plaintiffs.”    

12. 

United States v. BP Exploration & Production Inc.  concerns  the  United   States’  

claims for civil penalties under Section 311(b) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1321(b), and 
for a declaratory judgment of liability under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 33 U.S.C. 2701, et 
seq.,  and  the  Declaratory  Judgment  Act,  28  U.S.C.  §  2201.    The  United  States  sued  BP 

Exploration and Production, Inc., Anadarko Exploration & Production LP, Anadarko Petroleum 

Corporation, MOEX Offshore 2007  LLC,  various Transocean entities, and QBE Underwriting 

Ltd.,  Lloyd’s  Syndicate 1036.8  Other parties were added as third-party defendants.   

13. 

The “Phase  One”  trial commenced on February 25, 2013, and concluded on April 

17, 2013.9  Known  as  the  “Incident  Phase,” it addressed fault determinations relating to the loss 

of well control, the ensuing explosion and fire, the sinking of the DEEPWATER HORIZON, and 

the initiation of the release of oil from the well.  Phase One  also  considered issues  related to 

Transocean’s  limitation  defense, as well as the various cross-, counter-, and third-party claims 

between the several defendants.   

                                                 

8 QBE  Underwriting  Ltd.,  Lloyd’s  Syndicate  1036  allegedly  provided  evidence  of  financial  responsibility  and  

certain guarantees pertaining to one or more of the Transocean entities.   

9 The Phase One trial was originally scheduled to begin in 2012, but was delayed for a year after BP and the 

Plaintiffs  Steering  Committee  (“PSC”)  reached  agreement  on  two  class  settlements.           

 

8 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 9 of 153

14. 

“Phase  Two”  commenced on September 30, 2013, and concluded on October 18, 

2013.  This phase was divided into two segments: “Source  Control”  and  “Quantification.”    The 

former concerned issues pertaining to the conduct or omissions relative to stopping the release of 

hydrocarbons.  The latter segment pertained to the amount of oil actually released into the Gulf 

of Mexico, which is an important factor for determining the amount of civil penalties under the 

CWA.   

15. 

After  each  phase  the  parties  submitted  memoranda,  responses,  and  proposed 

findings.  Phase One post-trial memoranda and proposed findings were submitted on June 21, 

2013; response memoranda were submitted on July 12, 2013.  Phase Two post-trial memoranda 

and  proposed  findings  were  submitted  on  December  20,  2013;  response  memoranda  were 

submitted by January 27, 2014.

SUBSTANTIVE FINDINGS OF FACT 

A. 

The DEEPWATER HORIZON 
33. 

On  December  9,  1998,  predecessors  to  Transocean  Holdings,  LLC  and  BP 

America Production Company entered into a contract for the construction, use, and operation of 

the DEEPWATER HORZION.

34. 

The HORIZON entered service in 2001.  It was capable of drilling up to 35,000 

feet deep at a water depth of 10,000 feet.  Prior to Macondo, the HORIZON had successfully 

drilled approximately 50 wells.  All of these were in the Gulf of Mexico, and all except one were 

for BP.   

35. 

The HORIZON was 396 feet in length and 256 feet in breadth.  It floated on two 

massive pontoons.   Four large columns rose from the pontoon and supported the main deck, drill 

floor, derrick, bridge, engines, living quarters, helipad, cranes, etc.

37. 

The  HORIZON   was   a   mobile   offshore   drilling   unit   or   “MODU,”  which  is  a 

general  category  of  drilling  vessel.    The  HORIZON  was  a  self-propelled,  dynamically-

positioned, semi-submersible MODU.   

38. 

“Semi-submersible”   refers   to   the   fact   that   the   HORIZON   would  partially 

submerge itself during drilling operations, which increased  the  rig’s  stability. 

39. 

“Self-propelled”  refers  to  the  fact  that  the  HORIZON  used its eight large thrusters 

to move from place to place.13   

40. 

“Dynamically-positioned”   refers   to   the   fact   that   the   HORIZON   also   used   its  

thrusters to keep itself relatively stationary over a well, as opposed to relying on anchors or some 

other attachment to the seafloor.  Thus, one or more of the  HORIZON’s  thrusters  were active 

nearly all of the time, even when the rig was not making actual headway.       

41. 

The HORIZON had a master, chief mate, dynamic positioning operators, bosuns, 

able-bodied  seamen,  and  ordinary  seamen.    These  Transocean  employees  were  commonly 

referred   to   as   the   “marine   crew”   and   were   responsible   for,   among   other   things,   the   MODU’s  

navigation function and keeping the MODU “on station”  with  the  dynamic  positioning  system. 

There   were   other   Transocean   “crews”   aboard   the   HORIZON.      Notably,  the  “drill   crew”  was 

primarily  responsible  for  the  MODU’s  drilling  function and consisted of the Offshore Installation 

Manager, toolpushers, drillers, roustabouts, and others.  
B.  MC252 and the Macondo Well 

42. 

On March 19, 2008, BP Exploration and Production Inc. acquired a lease from the 

United States of 5,760 acres of property on the Outer Continental Shelf comprising Mississippi 

Canyon Block 252 (“MC252”).   

                                                 

to the Gulf of Mexico.   

13 In fact, the HORIZON propelled itself across the Atlantic Ocean during its maiden voyage from South Korea

43. 

BP  was  the  “operator”  of  the  Macondo  well  under  MMS14 regulations, meaning it 

was  “the  person  the  lessee(s) designates as having control or management of operations on the 

leased areas or a portion thereof.”15  As  operator  and  primary  leaseholder,  BP’s  responsibilities  

included  assessing  the  geology  of  the  site,  engineering  the  well  design,  obtaining  regulatory 

approvals  for  well  operations,  retaining  and  overseeing  the  project’s  contractors,  and  working  on  

various aspects of the well and drilling operations. 

44. 

BP America Production Company contracted with Transocean Holdings, LLC to 

drill the Macondo well in MC252.   

45. 

The Macondo well was drilled in approximately 5,000 feet of water, considered 

“deepwater”  in  the  current  oil  and  gas  industry.   It was located approximately 50 miles south of 

the Louisiana coast.  The initial well plan called for a total depth of 20,200 feet, measured from 

the deck of the MODU.16   

46. 

The DEEPWATER HORIZON was not initially chosen to drill the Macondo well.  

Instead,  the  MARIANAS,  another  Transocean-owned  semi-submersible,  spudded  the  well  on 

October 6, 2009. 

47. 

The MARINAS left the Macondo well in November 2009 after it was damaged 

by Hurricane Ida.  At that point the MARIANAS had drilled the well to approximately 9,000 feet 

deep. 

                                                 

14  “MMS”   refers   to  the  Minerals  Management  Service,  which  became  the  Bureau  of  Ocean  Energy 
Management, Regulation and Enforcement after the Macondo/DEEPWATER HORIZON event.  That agency was 
later  replaced  by  the  Bureau  of  Ocean  Energy  Management  and  the  Bureau  of  Safety  and  Environmental 
Enforcement.

bottom of the well would have been approximately 15,200 feet below the seafloor.

48. 

The DEEPWATER HORIZON was chosen to resume drilling the Macondo well.  

It left the Kodiak well—another BP well—and arrived onsite on January 31, 2010.  A few days 

later the HORIZON latched its BOP onto the wellhead.  Drilling resumed on February 11, 2010.

Drilling the Macondo Well   
 
49. 

Some Offshore Drilling Concepts  

In simplified terms, drilling  the Macondo well involved a repeated sequence of 

steps:  drill  a  certain  distance,  stop  drilling,  set  “casing”  to  reinforce  the  wellbore,  cement  the 

casing in place, drill further, stop, set more casing, and so forth.   

50. 

Casing is essentially large diameter pipe that is placed inside a drilled-out section 

of the well.  Once properly cemented in place, casing isolates the adjacent geologic formation 

(i.e., the rock) from the well.   

51. 

The top of each successive casing string was set inside the previous one.  Thus, 

the diameter of the well decreased slightly with each new piece of casing.  Setting casing also 

takes time.  Consequently, there are economic incentives for a well operator to set as few casing 

strings as possible. 

52. 

As a well is drilled, it encounters different layers of rock, some of which contain 

fluids—e.g., hydrocarbons or brine—within the pore spaces of the rock.  These fluids are under 

pressure  and, if the rock has sufficient permeability,  will flow into an area of  lower pressure.  

When formation fluids unintentionally flow  into  the  wellbore,  it  is  called  a  “kick.”    Unchecked, a 

kick  can  develop  into  a  “blowout,”  an  uncontrolled  flow  of  formation  fluids   into the wellbore 

and possibly to the surface.  Kick events involving oil or gas are particularly dangerous given the 

flammable nature of the hydrocarbons.  

53. 

During  normal  drilling  operations,  the  primary  means  of  preventing  kicks  and 

keeping the well under control is  by  maintaining an  “overbalanced”  state;;  i.e., pressure in the 

 

15 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 16 of 153

wellbore  is  greater  than  the   “pore  pressure”  of  any  exposed  formation(s).    This  is  typically 

achieved   by   pumping   a   dense   drilling   fluid,   commonly   known   as   “drilling  mud”  or  simply 

“mud,” into the well.  Generally speaking, if the  “mud weight”  (a  combination  of  mud  density  

and  the  length  of  the  mud  column)  is  greater  than  the  pore  pressure,  the  well  will  be 

overbalanced and formation fluids should not migrate into the well.   

54. 

If the only concern was ensuring that formation fluids did not flow into the well, 

then  a  well  operator  would  maintain  a  very  high  mud  weight.    This  is  not  the  only  concern, 

however.  If  the  mud  weight  exceeds  the  “fracture  gradient”  of  the  exposed  formation, the rocks 

will  fracture.    If  this  happens,  the  mud  may  escape  into  the  formation—what   is   called   “lost 

returns.”      Lost  returns  can  lower  the  pressure  inside  the  well  to  the  point  it  becomes 

“underbalanced,”  resulting  in  a  kick.     Large  fractures  can  also  cause  “underground  blowouts,” 

where  there  is  an  uncontrolled  flow  of  formation  fluids  through  the  well  from  one  zone  to 

another.   

55. 

Thus, deepwater drilling requires a delicate balance between pore pressure, mud 

weight, and fracture gradient.  Mud weight must be kept above the pore pressure but below the 

fracture gradient.  In fact, federal regulations required well  operators  to  maintain  a  certain  “safe  

drilling margin”  between  their  mud  weight  and   the  fracture   gradient.17  As  the  United  States’  

expert, Dr. Alan Huffman, explained, the drilling margin is intended to provide a sort of cushion 

for drilling operations.  If the well encounters an area with higher pore pressure, the operator will 

be able to increase the mud weight (to overpower the pore pressure and suppress a kick) without 

                                                 
the mud weight may not exceed 14.5 ppg.  See 30 C.F.R. § 250.427.     

17 For example, if a fracture gradient  is  15.0  pounds  per  gallon  (“ppg”)  and  the  safe  drilling  margin  is  0.5  ppg,  

 

16 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 17 of 153

fracturing the exposed rock.  If an operator cannot maintain the specified safe drilling margin, 

federal  regulations  require  it  to  “suspend  drilling  operations  and  remedy  the  situation.”18     

Drilling Operations at Macondo 

Drilling the Macondo well did not go smoothly.  Some called it the “well  from  

 
ii.
56. 

hell.”19  

57.  Many  of  the  problems  at  Macondo  stemmed  from  the  fact  that  the  well 

encountered increasingly fragile sandstone.  This contributed to a narrow window between pore 

pressure and fracture gradient, particularly as the well got deeper.  BP was aware of this issue, 

but did not always manage it properly.   

58. 

On October 26, 2009, while drilling with essentially no margin between the mud 

weight and the fracture gradient—much less the safe drilling margin required by the MMS—the 

MARIANAS experienced a kick at a depth of 8,970 feet.  The well was shut in (i.e., one or more 

of the sealing elements in the BOP were used to seal the well) and well control operations were 

initiated, which succeeded.  BP decided to drill 100 more feet so it could set casing in hard shale 

rather than in the delicate sandstone.  As BP contemporaneously acknowledged, its decision to 

drill another 100  feet  with  no  drilling  margin  came  with  a  risk  that  it  might  encounter  “another  

overpressured sand package that would initiate a  potentially  uncontrollable  well  control  event.”20  

The well was successfully drilled forward and BP was able to set the casing in shale.  Still, the 

casing  was  set  significantly  shallower  than  BP  had  planned.      As   Transocean’s   expert,   Calvin  

Barnhill,  concluded,   “Simply   put,   the   well   had   run   out   of   drilling   margin   requiring   the   18”  

drilling  liner  to  be  set  917’  high.”21

59. 

The  HORIZON  experienced  another  kick  on  March  8,  2010,  at  a  depth  13,250 

feet, when it drilled into a higher-than-anticipated pore pressure area.  The well was successfully 

shut in; however, the formation had collapsed around the drill pipe,  resulting  in  a  “stuck”  pipe.  

The pipe was severed with explosives and a cement plug was placed around the severed piece of 

pipe at the bottom of the well.  The well was then sidetracked; i.e., the HORIZON drilled around 

the stuck pipe and then continued downwards.    

60. 

The  cause  of  the  March  8th  kick  was  BP’s   decision   to   drill   faster   than   its 

geologists could analyze the data  from  the  well,  BP’s  decision  to  ignore the information it did 

have, or both.22   

61. 

62. 

The well also experienced multiple lost returns incidents.   

Notably, on April 4, 2010, the well lost total returns at a depth of 18,260 feet and 

was shut in.  Losing total returns means that all of the mud pumped from the rig escaped through 

open fractures in the formation at the bottom of the well.   

63. 

BP decided to spend the next 5 days pumping wellbore strengthening treatments 

in an effort to repair the formation.  BP also reduced the mud weight.  These efforts succeeded 

insofar as the well stopped losing returns, but the formation remained in a very fragile state.   

                                                 

22 BP’s  Geological  Operations  Coordinator concluded shortly after the March 8th kick that “the  accelerated rate 
of   penetration   and   the   resulting   ‘onslaught’   of   drilling   indicators   exceeded   the   ability   of   all   team   members   to  
effectively recognize, properly communicate, and decisively act upon available data.”    TREX  214  at  4.    Another  BP  
geologist  expressed  the   idea   more   succinctly:   “drilling   like   a   bat   out   of   hell   in   these   PP   [pore  pressure]   narrow-
window  wells  is  perhaps  not  wise.”    TREX  1072  at  1.    A  third  BP  geologist  voiced  a  slightly  different  view:  “After  
deciding  to  drill  ahead,  we  encountered  the  losses.    We  were  aware  of  the  upper  limit  of  the  ECD  [equivalent 
circulating  density]  and  exceeded  it  because  we  didn’t  believe  the  MWD  [measurement  while  drilling]LOT  [leak  off  
test] values.  I’m  not  sure  it  was  a  lack  of  communication  or  awareness  as  much  as a  ‘we  can  get  away  with  this’  
attitude . . . .  Prior to the kick, it was an active decision on the part of the drilling team to drill with a high ROP [rate 
of penetration] and let the cuttings take  up the  mudweight rather than drill at a  moderate rate and raise the MW 
[mudweight]  .  .  .  I’m  sorry  to  push  back  on  the  lessons  learned.    I  know  you’ve  got  to  get  something  out  there  to  
make it look like we wont do this again.  But without obvious indicators and with the real push to make hole and 
skip the contingency  liner,  I  don’t  see  us  really  learning.”    TREX  1136  (emphasis  added).

64. 

 “At  this  point,  [BP] was faced with a tough decision.”23  At 18,260 feet the well 

had encountered the primary reservoir sands, but BP needed to drill another 100 feet to ensure 

that the well was through the entire primary reservoir package and to be able to conduct wireline 

evaluation  operations  and  completion  procedures.    However,  as   BP’s   Geological   Operations  

Coordinator observed, drilling further meant it would  be  drilling  with  “minimal,  if  any,  drilling  

margin.”24   

65. 

On April 9, 2010, BP decided to drill the extra 100 feet.  Dr. Huffman, whom the 

Court found to be credible, viewed this decision as  “one  of  the  most  dangerous  things  [he]  had  

ever   seen   in   [his]   20   years’   experience”   and   “totally   unsafe.”25    The  Court  agrees  that  the 

decision was dangerous and further finds that it was motivated by profit.  

66. 

 After  drilling  the  extra  100  feet  BP  called  total  depth.    The  drilling  operation 

concluded at that point.   

67. 

At  18,360  feet  the  well  had  reached  its  primary  objective  sands,  but  not  the 

deeper,  secondary  objectives.    Indeed,  the  original  planned  depth  for  the  Macondo  well  was 

20,200 feet.   BP called total depth early because it  “had simply  run out of drilling margin.”26    

BP’s  Geological  Operations  Coordinator  stated,  “Drilling  ahead  any  further  would  unnecessarily  

jeopardize the wellbore . . . .  At this point  it  became  a  well  integrity  and  safety  issue.”27 

68. 

The  United  States’  expert,  Dr.  Huffman,  and  BP’s  expert,  Dr.  Adam  Bourgoyne,  

disagree over whether the decisions BP made relative to drilling were safe, in accordance with 

federal regulations, and consistent with industry standards.28

27 Id. 
28 Both experts agree on one point, however: When BP drilled forward in October 2009 with little or no drilling 

margin, it violated 30 C.F.R. § 250.427.

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 20 of 153

69. 

Although  the  Court  found  both  experts  well  qualified,  on  the  whole,  the  Court 

agrees  with  Dr.  Huffman’s  conclusions.    

70. 

Dr.  Bourgoyne  points  out  that  the  blowout  occurred  during  the  temporary 

abandonment procedure, days after the drilling phase concluded.  He concludes, then, that BP’s 

decisions during drilling had nothing to do with the blowout, explosion, or oil spill.   

71. 

Dr.  Bourgoyne’s  point  is  not  without  merit,  but  the Court does not entirely agree.  

Although drilling operations concluded without major catastrophe, the decision to drill the last 

100 feet of the well with little or no margin left the wellbore in an extremely fragile condition.29  

This resulted in the presence of a large amount of debris in the well when the production casing 

was  set  in  the  well  a  few  days  later.    As  will  be  explained,  this  debris  compromised  the 

production  casing,  which  led  to  the  incorrect  placement  of  cement,  which  in  turn  permitted 

hydrocarbons to enter the well on April  20,  2010.    Therefore,  BP’s  decision  to  drill  the  final  100  

feet was the initial link in a chain that concluded with the blowout, explosion, and oil spill.

Post-Drilling Operations: Production Casing and Temporary Abandonment 

As  of  April  9,  2010,  BP  was  $60  million  (60-70%)  over  budget  and  54  days 

behind schedule on the Macondo well.  For each additional day the HORIZON remained at the 

Macondo well, BP lost approximately another $1 million.  Moreover, the HORIZON was under 

pressure to get to the Nile well, and then to the Kaskida well, which BP needed to spud by May 

16th or face losing the lease.       

73. 

After  calling  total  depth,  BP  planned  to  set  production  casing  and  then 

temporarily abandon the Macondo well.   

                                                 

the rock formation.   

29 Indeed,  many  of  BP’s  subsequent  decisions  were  driven  largely  by  the  desire  to  avoid  any  further  damage  to  

 

20 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 21 of 153

74. 

The  production  casing  is  discussed  below.30    Temporary  abandonment  is  the 

process by which a well is secured so the operator can safely leave the well before returning to 

begin completion operations.  It involves placing cement or mechanical barriers in the well to 

replace the barriers formerly provided by the drilling mud and the BOP, which willd depart with 

the MODU.  It was intended that another rig would eventually come to Macondo, drill through 

the temporary barriers, perform completion operations, and turn Macondo into a producing well.   

75. 

The temporary abandonment procedure ultimately selected for the Macondo well 

involved a series of steps.  These included (1) setting a cement plug at the bottom of the well 

(known   as   the   “production   casing   cement”),   (2)   displacing   some   of   the   mud   in   the   well   to  

seawater and performing a negative pressure test, (3) displacing all of the mud above 8,367 feet 

to seawater, and (4) placing a second cement plug between 8,067 feet and 8,367 feet.   

76.  When the blowout occurred on the evening of April 20, 2010, steps (1) and (2) 

were complete and step (3),  known  as  “final  displacement,” was underway.  
D. 

Long String Casing vs. Liner With Tieback 

i.

Production Casing 
 
77. 

After a well has been drilled to total depth, additional tubing is typically installed 

that  will  allow  hydrocarbons  to  be  moved  from  the  target  formations  to  the  surface.    These 

lengths of tubing are known as production casing or production liners. 

78. 

BP selected a long string production casing for the Macondo well, which extends 

continuously from the wellhead at the seafloor to the bottom of the well.

Other  options  were  available,  such  as  a  production  liner.    A  production  liner 

attaches to the bottom of the previous casing and extends down to the bottom of the well.  The 

liner  is  later  “tied  back”  to  the  wellhead  with  separate  casing.

82. 

The  Court  heard  competing  opinions  regarding   the   reasonableness   of   BP’s  

decision  to  use  a  long  string  production  casing  instead  of  a  production  liner  with  tieback.  

Several  parties  proposed  that  BP’s  decision  was  unreasonable and primarily or entirely driven by 

a desire to cut costs.   

83. 

The weight  of  the  evidence  does  not  show  that  BP’s  decision  to  use  a  long  string  

production casing was unreasonable.  It is clear that BP’s  engineering  and  operational personnel 

thoroughly debated this issue.  There were pros and cons associated with each option, such that 

one  did  not  appear  significantly  more  advantageous  over  the  other  at  the  time  BP  made  its 

decision.  The initial cost savings associated with the long string production casing did enter the 

analysis, but it was one of several factors considered.

84. 

Furthermore, using a long string production casing instead of a production liner 

did not cause or contribute to the blowout.  As the Court understands the issue, the argument that 

BP should have used a liner is premised on the theory that hydrocarbons flowed up the outside of 

the production casing. At trial, however, the parties generally agreed that hydrocarbons entered 

the  production  casing  near  its  bottom  and  flowed  up  the  inside  of  the  casing.    Therefore,  the 

production casing versus production liner issue appears to be of little relevance.

Running the Production Casing 

The operation to run the production casing into the Macondo well commenced on 

April 18 at approximately 3:30 a.m. and concluded a day-and-a-half later on April 19 at around 

1:30 p.m. 

86. 

The  evidence  reflects  that  there  was  a  significant  amount  of  debris  in  the  well 

when  the  production  casing  was  run  on  April  18  and  April  19.    This  was  due  to  the  fragile 

wellbore.   

87. 

As the production casing was run down the well, some of the debris flowed up 

inside the casing.   

88. 

The bottom of the production casing was set into debris at the bottom of the well.  

This applied substantial compressive force to the production casing, causing it to buckle.33   

                                                 

33 Several pieces of evidence support the conclusions that there was debris in the well, the production casing 
was set in debris, and the production casing was compressed and buckled.  Prior to running the production casing, a 
wireline tool failed to reach the bottom of  the  well  “due  to  borehole  conditions,” and had to start logging the well at 
18,280 feet, rather than from the total depth, 18,360 feet.  TREX 3540.  On April 16, 2010—a few days after the 
wireline  event  and  two  days  before  running  the  production  casing—BP   engineer   Brian   Morel   asked,   “I   want   to  
know  if  [the  bottom  of  the  production  casing  is  at]  18,200’  and  [if  it  is]  set  down  on  something  how  much  weight  
can  I  slack  off  before  I  start  to  see  buckling?”    TREX  4515.    Halliburton  employee  Preeti  Paikattu  responded that the 
production casing will begin to buckle when 30,000 pounds of compressive force is applied at the bottom of the 
production   casing.      Halliburton’s   expert   Dr.   Gene   Beck   explained   at   trial   that   data   shows   the   production   casing  
actually experienced as much as 140,000 pounds of compressive force when it was landed on April 19.  When the 
production casing was run, the float collar (discussed below) was in the unconverted position without a mud filter.  
This allowed drilling mud and any debris in that mud to flow up the production casing and past the float collar as the 
casing  was  run  down  the  hole.    Finally,  the  drill  crew  was  unable  to  circulate  mud  through  the  well  after  the

The significance of the previous two findings will be explained later.34   

E. 

Overview of Cement Issues 
90. 

 As  mentioned  above,  a  major  step  in  the  temporary  abandonment  procedure 

involved setting a cement plug in the bottom of the well; i.e., the production casing cement job.  

The  purpose  of  this  cement  was  to  achieve  zonal  isolation,  i.e.,  to  isolate  the  hydrocarbon-

bearing zones in the formation from the well and prevent hydrocarbons from migrating into the 

well.  It was intended that the production casing cement, once pumped into place and sufficiently 

hardened, would take the place of the drilling mud as the primary barrier to hydrocarbon influx.   

91. 

No  one,  not  even  the  cement  contractor  Halliburton,  disputes  that  the  cement 

failed to achieve zonal isolation.  However, there are differing opinions as to why the cement 

failed. 

92. 

 There are two dimensions to the cement issue.  One concerns whether the cement 

pumped down the Macondo well was stable, and if not, whether this was due to an inherent vice 

in the cement or some outside factor.  This focuses on, among other things, the composition of 

cement slurry; or as the United  States’  expert  Glen  Benge  put  it,  the  “chemistry”  behind oil well 

cementing.  The other dimension concerns how the cement was placed in the well; specifically, 

whether the cement was placed across the hydrocarbon bearing sands as intended.  Mr. Benge 

referred  to  this  as  the  “physics”  of  oil  well  cementing.     

93.  Mr. Benge explained that proper cementing takes a combination of chemistry and 

physics.  In other words, the right type of cement must be placed in the right place in order to 

create  a  barrier  to  flow.    If  either  component  fails,  then  the  cement  will  not  achieve  zonal 

isolation.   

                                                                                                                                                             
production casing was set.  The parties agree that circulation could not be achieved because debris was blocking the 
flow path.

The Court will discuss cement placement first and cement composition second.     

F. 

Cement Placement 
95. 

The production  casing  cement  job  at  Macondo  was  designed  to  place  “foamed”  

cement  in  the  narrow  space  between  the  production  casing  and  the  formation  (known  as  the 

“annulus”35) and across the hydrocarbon bearing zones.  To do this, cement on the rig had to be 

pumped down the production casing, out the  “reamer shoe,”36 and then up the annulus.    

96. 

Before  cement  could  be  pumped,  however,  a  mechanical  device  known  as  a  “float  

collar”  had  to  be  converted from a two-way valve to a one-way valve. 

i.

 
97. 

The Weatherford M45AP Float Collar 

At  Macondo,  the  bottom  189  feet  of  the  production  casing  was  called  the  “shoe  

track.”    The float collar was located at the top of the shoe track. 

98. 

A float collar is essentially a valve.  Its purpose is to prevent unset cement, once 

pumped into the  annulus,  from  “u-tubing”  and  flowing  back  into  the  casing.    The  float  collar  also  

serves as a landing profile for plugs later sent down the well as a part of the cementing operation. 

99. 

The  specific  model  float  collar  used  at  Macondo  was  the  Weatherford  M45AP 

float  collar.    The  M45AP  float  collar  contained  two  spring-loaded  flapper  valves.    In 

“unconverted” mode,  an  internal  sleeve  called  an  “auto-fill  tube”  holds  these  valves  open,  which  

allows fluid to flow through the float collar in either direction (up or down).  Shear pins hold the 

auto-fill  tube  in  place  across  the  valves.    When  the  float  collar  is  “converted,” the auto-fill tube is 

ejected from the valves, allowing them to close.  When properly converted, fluid from above can 

                                                 

35 Annulus or annular space refers to the doughnut-shaped area which surrounds a cylindrical object within a 

larger  cylinder.    These  Findings  of  Fact  will  use  “annulus”  in  a  variety  of  contexts.     

36 The reamer shoe was located at the very bottom of the production casing.  It was designed to help guide the 
production casing past obstructions as it  was run down the hole to the bottom of the well.  The reamer shoe also 
contained three small ports through which fluid could flow into or out of the casing. 

 

26 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 27 of 153

push the valves open and flow down through the float collar; however, the valves prevent fluid 

from flowing back up through the float collar.   

100. 

Inside the auto-fill tube was a 2-inch diameter ball.  As designed, the ball was free 

to float the length of the auto-fill tube but could not exit the tube at either end.  As the production 

casing  was  run  down  the  well  in  unconverted  mode,  drilling  mud  would  flow  up  through  the 

bottom of the auto-fill tube and push the ball to the top tube.  Three fingers would keep the ball 

from exiting the tube, and mud would flow around the ball and out the top of the tube.  Once 

casing  was set, the ball  would fall to the bottom of the auto-fill tube  and land on a ball seat, 

blocking the relatively large opening at the bottom of the auto-fill tube.  Smaller ports in the side 

of the auto-fill tube would remain open, however.  At this point, mud pumped down through the 

auto-fill  tube  should  exit  the  tube  through  these  smaller  ports.    These  ports  restricted  flow 

through  the  tube,  but  flow  should  not  be  blocked  entirely.    The  intended  result  is  that  the 

restriction would create a pressure differential across the auto-fill tube; i.e., there will be greater 

pressure inside and above the auto-fill tube (before the restriction) than there is below the auto-

fill tube (past the restriction).  As the pump rate increases, so does the pressure differential, until 

the shear pins holding the auto-fill tube give way and the tube is ejected from the valve openings.   

101.  Weatherford’s   specifications   stated   that   converting   the   M45AP   float   collar  

required circulating37 drilling  mud  at  a  rate  of  5  to  8  barrels  per  minute  (“bpm”)  to  create a flow-

induced pressure differential of 500 to 700 psi.   

                                                 

37 In this context, “circulate”  means  to  pump  mud  from  the  rig  down  the  casing,  through  the  float  collar,  out  the  

ports in the reamer shoe, up the annulus between the casing and the well bore, and back to the rig.

The Attempted Conversion of the Float Collar  

 
ii.
103.  Successful  conversion  of  the  float  collar  is  a  prerequisite  to  commencing 

cementing operations.   

104.  BP  was  responsible  for  determining  whether  the  float  collar  converted  and 

whether the cement job should commence.   

105.  The  operation  to  convert  the  float  collar  at  Macondo  started  on  April  19,  2010 

around 2:30 p.m., after the production casing was run into the well.   

106.  The float collar could have been converted prior to running the casing down the 

hole.    In  fact,  BP’s  own  “best  practices”  called  for  converting  the  float  collar  before  running  it

across any hydrocarbon bearing zones.  However, BP was concerned that running the production 

casing  with  the  float  collar  converted  might  create  high  surge  pressures,  that  could  further 

damage the fragile rock formation.  Consequently, BP decided not to convert the float collar until 

after the production casing was fully run.   

107.  The  decision  to  run  the  production  casing  with  the  float  collar  in  unconverted 

mode was not unreasonable given the circumstances, at least not when viewed in isolation.  In 

fact,   the   M45AP   float   collar   is   specifically   designed   for   “[p]ressure   sensitive   formations   and  

close tolerance annuli, where surge reduction or fast running speeds  are  desirable.”39  However, 

running the casing with the float collar in unconverted mode increased the risk that debris from 

the  well  would  flow  into  and  plug  the  reamer  shoe,  the  float  collar,  or  both.    BP  could  have 

mitigated this risk by using a shoe filter, which is designed to filter cuttings and other debris that 

could   possibly   plug   the   float   equipment.      In   fact,   Weatherford’s   specifications   stated   that   the  

M45AP  float  collar  “should  be  run  with  a  Weatherford  Mud Master  filter  shoe.”40  BP did not 

use any type of shoe filter. 

108.  When  BP  first  attempted  to  convert  the  float  collar,  the  rig  crew  could  not 

circulate mud at all—mud was pumped down the well but there was no return mud at the surface.  

Pressure on the casing also started increasing during the attempted conversion. 

109.  The  only  explanation  given  at  trial  as  to  why  mud  would  not  circulate  is  that 

debris blocked the flow path.  However, the parties disagree over exactly where the blockage or 

blockages occurred.  The evidence reflects that on April 19, 2010, BP personnel involved with 

the Macondo well also believed debris blocked circulation, although they would not have known 

for certain how many blockages existed or exactly where the blockages were located.

110.  The Court finds that debris blocked the flow path at two points, if not more:  the 

float collar and the reamer shoe.41  Debris likely flowed up and around the auto-fill tube while 

the  production  casing  was  being  run  down  the  hole  in  unconverted  mode.    As  Halliburton’s  

expert Dr. Gene Beck pointed out, the smallest hole in the flow path, and therefore the easiest to 

clog, was the auto-fill  tube.    The  reamer  shoe’s  ports  were  likely  clogged  when  the  production  

casing was pressed into debris at the bottom of the hole.42   

111.  When mud circulation could not be initially achieved, BP directed the rig crew to 

repeatedly increase and then bleed off the pressure in the well—a  process  BP  called  “rocking”—

which was intended to clear the debris.   

112.  Nine attempts were made over the course of two hours to clear the blockage and 

convert the float collar.  Each attempt, with the exception of the sixth, used greater pressure than 

the last.  During the sixth attempt the pressure was kept the same as it was for the fifth attempt, 

but the pump rate was increased from 1 bpm to 2 bpm.     

113.  During these nine attempts the pump rate never rose above 2 bpm.  BP chose to 

keep pump rates low because it was concerned about damaging the fragile rock formation. 

114.  Circulation was achieved on the ninth attempt with 3,142 psi and a flow rate of 1 

bpm.  This is approximately five times the pressure and less than one quarter the flow rate called 

for  in  Weatherford’s  specifications.     

115.  Even after circulation broke, BP never directed the rig crew to pump at more than 

4 bpm.

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 31 of 153

116.  When circulation broke on the ninth attempt, there was a rapid depressurization 

from  3,142  psi  to  about  150-200  psi.    After  circulation  broke,  the  circulating  pressure  was 

significantly lower than predicted.   

117.  After noticing the rapid depressurization and/or the low circulating pressure, BP 

personnel expressed concern: 

118.  A  Halliburton  cement  engineer,  while  standing  on  the  rig  floor,  overheard  BP 
Well  Site  Leader43  Bob   Kaluza   state   “I   need   to   make   a   phone   call.   We  may  have  blown 
something higher up in the casing.”44   

119. 

In a post-incident interview with BP investigators, Bob Kaluza was recorded as 

saying  “[m]y  opinion  is  that  after  it  sheared  the  flow  came  back  real  quick.    I  said  ‘Wow  look  at  

how  much  fluid  we  got  back.’  Halliburton  had  modeled  that  at  4bbls/min  pressure  should be 570 
psi.    Ramped  up  in  1  bbl  increments  slowly  to  4bbls/min  at  350  psi.    I  said  ‘that is odd you guys 
this is very low.’  .  .  .  Switched  pumps  from  number  3  to  number  4  took  205  psi  to  break  over  
then at 4 bbls/min had 390 psi.   That was an anomaly.  I discussed it with  [BP Wells Team 

Leader] John  Guide  and  Keith  Dagle.    John  said  pump  cement.”45   

120.  Brian Morel, a BP drilling engineer who was on the HORIZON at the time, wrote 
in an e-mail dated April 19, 2010, “Yah,  we  blew  it  at  3,142,  but still not sure what we blew 
yet.”46   

121.  Mark  Hafle,  BP’s  senior  drilling  engineer  in  Houston,  wrote  in  an  e-mail dated 

April  19,  2010,  “Shifted  at  3,142  psi.    Or we hope so.    We  are  [circulating]  now.”47 

                                                 

43 The  “Well Site Leader”  is  BP’s  top  representative  on  the  rig.    The  industry  term  for  this  person  is  “company  

man.”    There  were  two  BP  Well  Site  Leaders  on  the  DEEPWATER  HORIZON:  Bob Kaluza and Don Vidrine.

122.  BP did take some steps to investigate these anomalies.   

123.  BP directed Transocean to circulate mud with a different mud pump, in case the 

low circulating pressure was due to an issue with the pump.  Circulating pressure increased after 

switching  pumps,  however,  it  still  remained  significantly  lower  than  expected.    Bob  Kaluza’s 

statement above confirms that the circulating pressure was still viewed as an anomaly even after 

switching pumps.   

124.  BP also considered the possibility that there was a leak in the system.  BP thought 

that  the  diverter  tool48  might  be  leaking,  but  was  able  to  confirm  that  it  was  closed  and  not 

leaking.     

125.  After the diverter tool was eliminated as a possible leak, BP consulted with M-I 

about the circulating pressures. M-I’s  response  to  BP’s  inquiry  is   reflected  in  an  e-mail  dated 

April 20, 2010 at 3:34 p.m. (the day after the attempted float collar conversion), where M-I’s  

Doyle Maxie wrote:  

I have gone through my inputs for VH [virtual hydraulics] for the modeling I did 
for circulating prior to cementing casing.  I have tried several different inputs, and 
the closest I can get is 480 psi and that is taking out the fann 70 data which is not 
giving  a  reasonable  estimate  of  true  pressure.    I have had several  individuals 
double check and critique[] my inputs and still cannot explain the difference.  
Looking  to  predictions  from  the  past  modeling  the  pressure  is  never  quite  the 
same  when  we  are  drilling  so  I  would  not  expect  them  to  be  the  same  for  this 
model.    Pressure  is  one  of  the  hardest  numbers  to  correlate.      I  would  be 
interested  to  see  what  Landmark  would  predict  as  circulating  pressures.    I  am 
open to sit down and discuss the inputs with the team.  John and I went through 
some scenario[s] this morning and we could not do any better than 480 psi.49

Mr.  Maxie’s   e-mail  was  sent  to  numerous  BP  personnel  involved  with  the  Macondo  well, 

including John Guide (Wells Team Leader), Brett Cocales (Senior Operations Engineer), Mark 

Hafle (Senior Drilling Engineer), and Brian Morel (Drilling Engineer).   

126.  Although  Mr.  Maxie’s   e-mail  notes  that  modeled  and  actual  pressures  are  not 

always  the  same  and  that  pressure  is  “one  of  the  hardest  numbers  to  correlate,”  the  fact  remains  

that the actual circulating pressure was lower than the modeled pressure.  Furthermore, although 

several  individuals  reviewed   Mr.   Maxie’s   calculations,   no   one   could   “explain   the   difference”  

between the modeled and actual circulating pressures. Therefore, M-I’s  response  to  BP’s  inquiry  

did not eliminate the possibility that there was a leak.  Moreover, BP  did  not  have  Mr.  Maxie’s  
response until the afternoon of April 20, after BP determined the float collar had converted and 

instructed Halliburton to pump the cement.   

127.  BP concluded on April 19 that the float collar converted based on the fact that 

circulation was established.  When asked on direct examination why he believed on April 19 that 

the  float  collar  converted,  BP  Wells  Team  Leader  John  Guide  responded,  “By  the  fact  that  we  

could  circulate.”50 

128.  Under the circumstances, achieving circulation was consistent with converting the 

float  collar.    However,  achieving  circulation  did  not  establish  that  the  float  collar  actually 

converted.   

129.  BP never verified whether or not the float collar actually converted. 

130.  After the cement job was pumped,  a  “float  check”  was performed, but it did not 

verify whether the float collar actually converted.  During a float check, pressure in the well is 

bled to zero and fluid from the well monitored for a period of time.  If the flow does not stop, it 

is an indication that the valves in the float collar have not converted and the heavier fluids in the

annulus  are  flowing  back  into  the  casing.    However,  a  reliable  float  check  requires  sufficient 

differential pressure in the annulus to lift the plug that has been forcibly set on top of the float 

collar.  All of the experts who considered the topic agreed that the differential pressure during 

the float check was too low to lift the plug.   

131.  As   the   United   States’   expert   Glen   Benge   explained,   BP  could  have  verified 

whether the float collar converted by having the drill crew attempt to reverse circulate; i.e., pump 

mud down the annulus and up the casing.  If the float collar had converted, the drill crew would 

not  be  able  to  reverse  circulate,  because  the  closed  flapper  valves  would  prevent  mud  from 

flowing up through the float collar.    

132.  BP did not attempt to reverse circulate the well.    

133.  Without  verifying  whether  the  float  collar  converted  and  without  resolving 

whether   something   was   “blown”   or   why   the   circulating   pressure   was   low—other  than  to 

conclude,  the  next  day,  that  the  predicted  pressures  must  have  been  incorrect—BP  instructed 

Halliburton to commence the cement job.    

The Float Collar Did Not Convert 

 
iii.
134.  As explained above, the auto-fill tube must be ejected from the valve openings in 

order to convert the float collar.   

135.  Halliburton’s   expert,   Dr.   Gene  Beck,  opined  that  the  float  collar  experienced  a 

mechanical failure when circulation  was  achieved at 3,142 psi.   Dr. Beck testified that  debris 

inside the production casing probably settled in and around the float collar, packing off the auto-

fill tube.  This held the auto-fill tube in place across the valves and prevented the shear pins from 

shearing.  According to Dr. Beck, on the ninth conversion attempt the ball seat at the bottom of 

the auto-fill ruptured and the ball inside the tube ejected, but the auto-fill tube remained across

the flapper valves.  This would allow fluid to pass freely through the float collar, but the flapper 

valves would remain open; i.e., unconverted.    

136.  Bill Ambrose,  who  was  in  charge  of  Transocean’s  incident  investigation,  testified  

that the Transocean investigation team similarly concluded that the float collar was clogged with 

debris and that the float collar never converted.   

137.  Dr.  Beck’s  opinion relies in part  on  testing  performed  during  Transocean’s  post-

incident investigation.  This testing reflects that the auto-fill tube could be ruptured and the ball 

ejected at pressures substantially less than 3,142 psi.  During one test the ball shot out the bottom 

of the auto-fill tube at 1,477 psi.  During a second test the ball shot out of the tube at 1,840 psi.   

138.  Dr.  Beck’s  theory  also  relies  on  the  fact  that  the  pressure  dropped  rapidly  from  

3,142 psi after circulation was achieved.  According to Dr. Beck, the rapid depressurization was 

a signature of mechanical failure, not of debris unplugging.  Dr. Beck explained that the pressure 

response for clearing blockage is a gradual change from high to low pressure as debris is cleared 

and  circulated  out.    This  description  is   consistent   with   testimony   from   Transocean’s   expert,  

Calvin Barnhill, when he testified about events that occurred on April 20.51  

139.  BP’s   counsel   pointed   out   that   some   of   the   components   on   the   float   collar  

Transocean  tested  were  different  from  those  used  at  Macondo.    BP  also  contends  that 

Transocean’s   test   did   not   allow   the   auto-fill   tube’s   shear   pins   to   activate.      BP   concluded  that 

Transocean’s   test   was   not   representative   of   actual   conditions.      Bill   Ambrose   essentially  

responded that the internal components of the float collar were the same and/or the differences 

were irrelevant for purposes of the test.

140.  Brent Lirette, a Weatherford employee, testified that it is not possible for the ball 

inside the auto-fill tube to be ejected while the auto-fill tube remained in place.   

141.  BP also conducted tests on the float collar after the incident.  These tests reflect 

that the M45AP float collar would convert at 3,142 psi without damaging the float collar.  The 

float collar tested on behalf of BP used the same components as the float collar used at Macondo.  

142.  Halliburton   points   out   that   BP’s   tests   did   not   account   for   the   effects   of   debris 

packed  inside  the  float  equipment.    Dr.  Beck  testified  that  “[O]nce  you  plug  things  up  .  .  .  all  bets  

are off on the performance of shear pins . . . . When you have debris around mechanical devices . 

. . the performance of that device is not always  as  designed.  .  .  .    I’ve  had  this  happen  before  

where  shear  pins  don’t  shear  when  they’re  supposed  to  when  .  .  .  you’re  working  in  an  unclean  

wellbore  environment.”52 

143.  Data from the negative pressure test that was conducted on the afternoon of April 

20, 2010, tips the balance in favor of the theory that the float collar did not convert.53  By the end 

of the Phase One trial there was general agreement that hydrocarbons entered the casing at some 

point  below  the  float  collar  and  then  flowed  up  the  casing.    Although  Weatherford’s  float  collar  

is not marketed as a barrier to flow, the M45AP float collar, once converted, is rated to withstand 

5,000  psi  differential  pressure  from  below.    Weatherford’s   Brent   Lirette   testified   during   cross  

examination that he would expect the converted float collar to withstand 5,000 psi differential 

pressure  from  below  after  the  float  collar   converted.    Transocean’s  post-incident tests showed 

that  the  flapper  valves,  when  properly  converted,  could  hold  at  least  3,000  psi  from  below.  

During the negative pressure test, 1,400 psi of pressure registered on the drill pipe, which was 

above the float collar.  Given that  hydrocarbons entered the casing below the float collar, the 

                                                 

52 Transcript at 7343:9-10, 7378:11-15 (Beck). 
53 The negative pressure test is described in Part III.H.ii, infra.

1,400 psi pressure during the negative pressure test must have communicated through the float 

collar  in  order  to  register  on  the  drill  pipe.    Therefore,  if  the  float  collar  had  converted,  it  is 

unlikely 1,400 psi would have registered on the drill pipe.   

144.  The Court finds that the float collar did not fully and properly convert on April 

19, 2010, or anytime thereafter.  On the ninth conversion attempt, the float collar experienced a 

mechanical failure.  The most likely point of failure was the ball seat at the bottom of the auto-

fill tube.   

iv.

The Shoe Track Breached During the Attempted Float Collar Conversion 

 
145.  As discussed above, Dr. Beck believes the rapid drop in pressure from 3,142 psi is 

a  signature  of  mechanical  failure,  not  of  debris  unplugging.54    Dr.  Beck  opined  that  two 

mechanical failures occurred.  The first failure was the float collar, discussed above.  Dr. Beck 

also  testified  that  a  second  failure  occurred  in  the  shoe  track  (i.e.,  the  casing  below  the  float 

collar).   

146.  As  mentioned  above,  the  circulating  pressures  were  lower  than  expected  after 

circulation was achieved at 3,142 psi.   

147.  Dr.  Beck  opined  that  the  rapid  depressurization  and  lower-than-expected 

circulating pressure, when viewed together, demonstrate that rather than circulating mud through 

the  three  small  ports  at  the  bottom  of  the  reamer  shoe,  the  rig  was  actually  circulating  mud 

through a larger breach or opening in the shoe track below the float collar.     

148.  This opinion is consistent with the testimony of Bill Ambrose, who stated that the 

lower-than-expected   circulating   pressure   indicated   that   “something   has   opened   up   in   a   larger  

                                                 

54 As  noted  above,  this  opinion  is  consistent  with  testimony  by  Transocean’s  expert,  Calvin  Barnhill.

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 38 of 153

geometry”  in  the  path  of  circulation.55  Similarly, Mr. Barnhill proposed in his report that the low 

circulating  pressure  indicated  “[p]ossible  damage  to  casing  shoe  track.”56 

149.  Dr.   Beck’s   opinion   is   also   consistent   with   testimony   by   United   States’   expert  

Glen Benge, who stated:  

[I]t  was  acknowledged  that  whenever  that  3,100-odd  psi  –  when  it  suddenly 
released,  that’s  a  big  concern  — that’s  a  big  risk  because at that point you do not 
know  where  in  the  well  you’re  circulating.  You’ve  got  a  sudden  pressure  surge,  
and pressures were much lower, showing that some restriction that  you used to 
have  isn’t  there  anymore.     
. . . 
[I]f you broke something and the circulating  pressure  is  lower,  you’re  not  really  
sure  of  where  you’re  circulating.     
. . . 
Operationally   you   could   have   had   a   break   in   that   well   somewhere,   and   you’re  
circulating at a much higher point.57       
 
150.  Notably, Bob Kaluza’s  statement on April 19,  “We may have blown something 

higher  up  in  the  casing”  shows that the Well Site Leader was concerned that the casing may have 

breached on the ninth attempt.  Brian  Morel’s  statement  on  April  19,  “Yah,  we  blew  it  at  3,142, 

but still not sure what we blew yet,” arguably reflects a similar concern.   

151.  Returning  to  Dr.  Beck’s  theory,  Dr.  Beck  believes  that,  up  until  the  float  collar  

mechanically  failed,  the  debris  blockage  in  the  float  collar/auto-fill  tube  prevented  pressure 

above the float collar from communicating below it.  When the float collar failed on the ninth 

attempt, the 3,142 psi of pressure58 that had been isolated at and above the float collar, suddenly 

transmitted to the casing below.  Dr. Beck explained that the rapid depressurization from 3,142 

psi indicates that a sudden pressure surge or shock wave was imparted on the casing below the

58 For clarity, the Court understands that 3,142 psi represents differential pressure.  The ambient pressure at the 

bottom of the well was much higher than 3,142 psi.

float  collar  at  this  time.    This   is   consistent   with   Glen   Benge’s   testimony   quoted   above,  

particularly  his  reference  to  pressure  “suddenly  releas[ing]”  and  “a  sudden  pressure  surge.”   

152. 

In response to questions during cross examination about how it was possible for 

3,142 psi to breach casing that was rated to withstand substantially higher pressures, Dr. Beck 

explained  that  the  casing  was  already  in  a  state  of  extreme  stress  when  the  pressure  surge 

occurred.  Dr. Beck testified that when the production casing was run down the wellbore and set 

into debris,59 as much as 140,000 pounds of compressional force was applied to it.  This caused 

the casing to buckle.60  Dr. Beck explained that buckling magnified the stress due to compression 

by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5, because the casing is bent in addition to being compressed.   

153.  Dr.   Beck’s   testimony   about   buckling   is   consistent   with   e-mails  dated  April  16, 

2010, between BP engineer Brian Morel and Halliburton employee Preeti Paikattu.61  There Mr. 

Morel asked at what point the production casing would buckle if it were landed on top of an 

obstruction.    Ms.  Paikattu  responded  that  the  casing  would  buckle  if  30,000  pounds  of 

compressional force was applied to the casing, and that this buckling would occur low in the 

casing.     

154.  Dr.  Beck  concluded  that  the  sudden  pressure  surge  or  shock  wave  that  was 

released on the ninth conversion attempt, combined with the extreme stress already imposed on 

the casing, was sufficient to breach the shoe track below the float collar.   

155.  The   Court   agrees   with   Dr.   Beck’s   opinion  and  finds  that  a  breach  or  opening 

occurred in the shoe track during the ninth attempted conversion.   

59 See supra Part III.D.ii. 
60  Dr.   Beck’s   exact   words   were   that   the   compression   applied   to   the   production   casing   at   Macondo   would  

“buckle  the  daylights  out  of  it.”    Transcript  at  7380:4  (Beck).

156.  The Court finds particularly persuasive the fact that a breach in the shoe track is 

consistent  with,  and  thus  provides  an  explanation  for,  the  data  recorded  after  circulation  was 

achieved—most notably the lower-than-expected circulating pressures.  Contrariwise, the Court 

finds BP’s  apparent  explanation  for  the  low  circulation  pressures—that the predicted pressures 

must have been incorrect—unpersuasive.  

157.  Furthermore, a breach in the shoe track is also consistent with, or at least is not 

incompatible  with,  other  evidence  and  testimony  regarding  cement  placement  and  how 

hydrocarbons entered the well, as explained below. 

 
v.

Cement  Was  Pumped  Through  the  Breach  in  the  Shoe  Track  and  Placed 
Improperly; Hydrocarbons Later Entered the Well Casing Through the Breach in 
the Shoe Track 

158.  Pumping the production casing cement began at 7:30 p.m. on April 19, 2010, and 

finished  around  12:30  a.m.  on  April  20,  2010.    Approximately  60  barrels  of  cement  were 

pumped,  48  barrels  of  which  were  “foamed”  cement.     

159.  One  purpose  of  the  shoe  track  was  to  assist  in  placing  cement  in  the  annulus 

during the production casing cement job.  

160.  The  production  casing  cement  job  was  designed  to  pump  unfoamed  “cap”  cement  

down   the   well   first,   followed   by   foamed   cement,   and   then   unfoamed   “tail”   cement.62    As 

planned, the cap cement and the foamed cement would travel down through the float collar and 

shoe track, exit through the three holes in the reamer shoe, and then head up the annulus between 

the casing and formation. 

161. 

If  properly  conducted,  foamed  cement  should  have  been  placed  in  the  annulus 

across  the  hydrocarbon  bearing  zones.    The  cap  cement  would  be  in  the  annulus  above  the 

62  Base  oil,  spacer,  and  a  bottom  wiper  plug  were  pumped  ahead  of  the  cap  cement.    A  top  wiper  plug  and 

                                                 
spacer were pumped after the tail cement.  See infra Figure 6.

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 41 of 153

foamed cement.  A small amount of tail cement would also be in the annulus below the foamed 

cement.  Tail cement would fill the shoe track.   

162.  Figure 6 illustrates the intended  placement of cement fluids in the annulus  and 

shoe track and across hydrocarbon-bearing zones (yellow) and brine-bearing zones (blue): 

Figure 6 63 

 

163.  Dr. Beck testified that if there was a tiny breach or opening in the shoe track, a 

significant amount of the cement would exit the casing through that point rather than through the 

reamer shoe as intended.  If the breach was greater than one square inch in diameter, virtually all 

of the cement would pass through the rupture point.

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 42 of 153

164.  Dr.  Beck  further  testified  that  cement  pumped  through  the  rupture  would 

immediately turn up the annulus; no cement would be placed below the rupture point.  Dr. Beck 

also testified that a breach in the shoe track would prevent cement from being placed in the shoe 

track.   

165.  Dr. Beck believes that cement was pumped through the breach in the shoe track, 

rather than through the holes in the reamer shoe.  Consequently, cement was not placed across 

the  hydrocarbon-bearing  sands  below  the  rupture  point.    Therefore,  the  hydrocarbon-bearing 

sands  below  the  breach  in  the  shoe  track  were  left  exposed  to  the  well  and  had  unrestricted 

access into the casing through the breach in the shoe track.     

166.  The  Court  agrees  with  Dr.  Beck’s  theory.   

167.  As already noted, a rupture in the shoe track is consistent with the sudden drop in 

pressure from 3,142 psi and the lower-than-expected circulating pressures.   

168.  Dr.  Beck  also  testified  that  the  blowout  occurred  relatively  quickly,  which 

indicates   that   there   was   not   much   restriction   to   flow.      Dr.   Beck’s   theory   regarding   cement  

placement and the flow path of oil is consistent with the rapid blowout and little restriction to 

flow.64   

169.  Dr.  Beck  pointed  out  that  his  theory  is  also  consistent  with  evidence  from  the 

relief well, which did not encounter hydrocarbons when it intercepted the upper annulus of the 

Macondo  in  September  of  2010.    He  testified  that  the  absence  of  hydrocarbons  in  the  upper 

annulus shows that the cement placed above the rupture point did set up and provide a barrier to 

flow.  Dr. Beck further explained that, if cement had been properly placed in the annulus and the 

shoe track, one would not expect some of the annular cement to set up while the rest of the lower 

annulus and shoe track did not.  The Court agrees that the absence of hydrocarbons in the upper 
                                                 

64 A rapid blowout is also consistent with an unconverted float collar.   

 

42 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 43 of 153

annular  section  is  certainly  consistent  with  Dr.  Beck’s  theory.    However,  the  Court  notes  that  this  

is not  as  persuasive  as  the  other  evidence  supporting  Dr.  Beck’s  theory.    For  instance,  the  relief  

well evidence is also consistent with the competing theory that hydrocarbons entered the casing 

through the ports in the reamer shoe. 

vi.

 

The Court Is Not Persuaded  by  BP’s  Theories  Regarding  Float  Collar  Conversion,  
Cement Placement, and Flow Path  

170.  BP’s  position  is  that  the  float  collar  converted properly, the shoe track was not 

breached, and cement was properly placed in the annulus and shoe track.  Furthermore, BP (and 

the  private  plaintiffs,  Alabama,  and  Louisiana)  believe  hydrocarbons  traveled  through  the 

foamed cement in the annulus, down the annulus, entered the casing through holes in the reamer 

shoe, through the tail cement in the shoe track, through the converted float collar, and up the 

casing. 

171.  BP believes that the foamed cement was unstable, which permitted hydrocarbons 

to  migrate  from  the  formation  through  the  cement,  down  the  annulus,  and  up  into  the  casing 

through the reamer shoe.  BP further proposes that the unfoamed, tail cement placed in the shoe 

track failed to stop the influx either because it was contaminated by the nitrogen from the foamed 

cement  or  because  the  hydrocarbons  encountered  the  shoe  track  cement  before  it  had  an 

opportunity  to  harden.    BP  believes  the  float  collar  had  converted,  but  failed  to  stop  the 

hydrocarbons because a float collar is not intended to provide a barrier to hydrocarbon flow.   

172.  BP’s  theory  that  hydrocarbons entered through the reamer shoe is primarily based 

on the work of its expert, Morten Emilsen.  Using sophisticated computer software, Mr. Emilsen 

created a model of the  well based on  certain  known data.   Mr. Emilsen  then ran hundreds of 

computer simulations that made different assumptions about unknown data, such as flow path.  

The  modeled  results  were  compared  with  certain  recorded  data  from  the  well  (e.g.,  drill  pipe 

 

43 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 44 of 153

pressure).  If the modeled results for a particular scenario did not match the recorded data, then 

Mr. Emilsen concluded that the scenario likely did not occur.  When Mr. Emilsen assumed that 

the flow path was through the holes in the reamer shoe and that 13 to 16.5 feet of the formation 

was exposed to the well bore—what  he  termed  “Case  7”—the modeling closely matched much 

of the known data.  Based on this match, Mr. Emilsen concluded, among other things, that the 

flow  path  was  “through  a  leaking  casing  shoe  and  up  through  the  inside  of  the  casing.”65    

173.  Despite running hundreds of simulations, Mr. Emilsen never ran a simulation that 

assumed the flow path was through a breach in the shoe track below the float collar.  Because he 

had not investigated that scenario, Mr. Emilsen could not state whether  a model that assumed 

flow through a breach in the shoe track would also produce results matching the recorded well 

data.  However, Mr. Emilsen did indicate that flow through the shoe track would probably have 

little effect on at least some variables.66  Moreover, Mr. Emilsen could not exclude the breached 

shoe track  as a plausible theory,  given that he  did not run this scenario through his  modeling 

program.        

174.  Mr. Emilsen made a number of assumptions about the conditions at the bottom of 

the well.  These assumptions cause the Court to question the accuracy of his conclusion insofar 

as it concerns the precise location and manner hydrocarbons entered the casing.67     

175. 

In  short,  Mr.  Emilsen’s  work  does  little  to  discredit  the  theory  that  hydrocarbons 

entered  the  casing  through  a  breach  in  the  shoe  track.    Mr.  Emilsen’s  testimony  does  not  prove  

                                                 

65 TREX 40003 at 7 (Emilsen Report); see also TREX 7401.  At trial Mr.  Emilsen  made  clear  that  by  “leaking  

casing  shoe”  he  meant  hydrocarbons  traveled  up  through  the  holes  in  the  reamer  shoe.     

66  When   asked   to   comment   on   a   picture   from   Dr.   Beck’s   report   depicting   a   possible   shoe   track   breach,   Dr.  
Emilsen   stated,   “I   think,  the  distance  from  –  there   is   no   scale   here,   but   it’s   not   a   long   distance.      So   in   terms   of  
frictional  pressure  drop,  etcetera,  I  can  agree  that  it’s  not  a  major  part  of  the  wellbore  that  you’re  disconnecting,  if  
you  like,  with  this  picture.”    Transcript  at 7896:16-20 (Emilsen). 

67 To be clear, the Court found Mr. Emilsen generally credible and believes that his modeling was accurate in 

many other respects.     

 

44 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 45 of 153

that  hydrocarbons  entered  through  the  reamer  shoe,  nor  does  it  disprove  that  hydrocarbons 

entered through a breach in the shoe track. 

176.  BP’s  theory  regarding  flow  path,  etc.,  ignores  or  dismisses  the  data  recorded  after  

circulation was achieved on the ninth conversion attempt, particularly the lower-than-expected 

circulation  pressure,  which,  as  noted,  indicated  that  a  larger  opening  was  created  in  the  flow 

path.      BP’s   theory   also   requires   a   succession   of   failures.      While  there  is  ample  evidence  to 

support the idea that the foamed cement was unstable, and therefore probably would have failed 

even if properly placed in the annulus, there is less evidence to support the notion that the tail 

cement in the shoe track also failed, and even less evidence that the float collar, if converted, 

would not have stopped pressure from communicating during the negative pressure test.  Yet all 

of  these  things  must  occur  in  order  for  BP’s  theory  to  be  correct. 

177.  To be fair, Dr. Beck also proposes what could be viewed as an unlikely chain of 

failures  (production  casing  buckled,  float  collar  clogged,  auto-fill  tube  ruptured,  shoe  track 

breached).      This   comes   as   little   surprise,   though,   given   that   BP’s   entire   explanation   for   this  

tragedy and overarching theme at trial was that there was a series of failures.68  The difference is 

that  there  is  more  support  for  Dr.  Beck’s  chain  of  failures  than  there  is  for  BP’s  chain  of  failures.   

178.  To conclude, the Court finds that when cement was pumped on April 19 and April 

20, most of it exited the casing through a breach in the shoe track below the float collar, rather 

than through the reamer shoe.  Consequently, no cement was placed in the annulus below the 

breach point, and little or no cement was placed in the shoe track below the breach point.  When 

hydrocarbons later entered the casing on April 20, they flowed through the breach in the shoe 

track.

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 46 of 153

179.  Given  this  conclusion,  the  Court  further  finds  that   BP’s   cementing   program  
violated 30 C.F.R. § 250.420, which required it to, inter alia,  “[p]revent  the  direct  or  indirect 

release  of  fluids  from  any  stratum  through  the  wellbore  into  offshore  waters.” 

vii.

Cement Bond Log 

 
180.  After a cement job is pumped, a cement evaluation technique such as a cement 

bond  log  (“CBL”) can be used to evaluate whether zonal isolation was achieved.  A CBL uses 

acoustic signals and associated software to derive a representation of the integrity of a cement 

job.   

181.  Although  the  location  of  the  float  collar  in  the  production  casing  would  have 

prevented   a   CBL   from   evaluating   the   entire   annulus   in   the   well’s   production   interval,   it   still  

would have been able to determine the location of the top of cement.  If the top of cement was 

not at the designed location, it would indicate that the cement job was not properly placed and/or 

that channeling69 had occurred.   

182.  BP was responsible for deciding whether or not to run a CBL.   

183.  BP’s  internal  best  practices  stated  that  BP  should  have  performed  a  CBL. 

184.  When  the  Macondo  cement  job  was  performed,  a  Schlumberger  team  (another 

contractor hire by BP) was standing by on the HORIZON and could have performed a CBL if 

BP requested them to do so.   

185.  After the cement job on the morning of April 20, 2010, BP decided not to run the 

CBL and sent the Schlumberger personnel back to shore.   

                                                 

69 Channeling is a condition in which cement flows preferentially only on some sides of the casing or borehole 
and thus does not provide radial coverage around all sides of the casing or borehole. Channeling creates potential 
communication paths for hydrocarbons.   

 

46 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 47 of 153

186.  BP’s  decision  to  not  conduct  the  CBL  accorded  with  a  decision  tree  it  had  created  

specifically for the Macondo well temporary abandonment.  The decision tree called for a CBL if 

“full  returns”  were  not  observed  during  the  cement  job.     

187.  Because full returns were observed during the cement job, BP decided to not run 

the CBL.   

188.  Additionally, during a teleconference meeting on the morning of April 20, 2010, 

BP  Wells  Team  Leader  John  Guide  asked  if  a  CBL  should  be  run.    No  one  said  it  should.  

Employees from BP, Halliburton, and Transocean attended that meeting.   

189.  Lack of full returns indicates that cement or some other fluid in the well escaped 

into the reservoir during the cement job.  Observing full returns is consistent with placing cement 

in  the  appropriate  location.    However,  full  returns  do  not  establish  that  cement  was  placed 

correctly.     

190.  BP  had  multiple  reasons  to  suspect  the  cement  job  would  fail  to  achieve  zonal 

isolation.  A CBL would have resolved some of these suspicions.  

191.  As discussed above, BP had issues with attempting to convert the float collar and 

BP  personnel  expressed  doubt  about  whether  it  had  actually  converted.    BP  knew  that  an 

unconverted  float  collar  could  result  in  the  cement  “u-tubing”  out  of  the  annulus  and  back  into 

the well casing.  There was also expressed concern that the casing had breached.  BP knew or 

should have known that a breach in the casing could result in cement not being placed in the 

intended  location.    A  CBL  would  have  revealed  if  cement  u-tubed,  exited  through  a  higher 

breach in the casing,  or  both.    Therefore,  BP’s  concerns  should  have  motivated  it  to  run  the  CBL.     

192.  BP knowingly assumed other risks with the production casing cement job.  While 

these risks may not have contributed directly to  the  blowout,  particularly  in  light  of  the  Court’s  

 

47 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 48 of 153

conclusion that the  shoe  track  was  breached,  BP’s  knowledge of these risks should have further 

motivated   it   to   run   the   CBL.      These   risks   include:      BP’s   decision   to   use   only   6   centralizers,  

despite being told  by  Halliburton’s  Jesse  Gagliano  that  computer  modeling  predicted  channeling  

would occur unless 21 centralizers were used;70 and  BP’s  decision  not  to  perform  a  full  bottoms-

up  circulation  of  mud  prior  to  pumping  the  production  casing  cement  job,  despite  BP’s  

knowledge  that  there  was  debris  in  the  well  (which  can  cause  channeling  or  otherwise  affect 

cement  placement)  and  Jesse  Gagliano’s  recommendation  that  a  full  bottoms-up be performed in 

order to help alleviate the channeling predicted to occur with only 6 centralizers.71     

193.  BP also decided to use a low volume of cement compared to its previous cement 

jobs.    As  United  States’  expert  Glen  Benge  explained,  using  a  small  amount  of  cement  meant  
                                                 

70 The Court finds that using only 6 centralizers did not cause the cement to fail.  Nevertheless, BP knew that 
using only 6 centralizers could lead to channeling and knew or should have known that a CBL would likely reveal 
channeling if it occurred.  That BP knowingly accepted this risk is demonstrated in, among other things, an e-mail 
on April 16, 2010, between BP engineers Brett Cocales and Brian Morel. When the e-mail  was  written,  BP’s  John  
Guide (Wells Team Leader) and Greg Walz (Drilling Engineering Team Leader) had decided to use 6 centralizers 
because they believed the 15 additional centralizers were a type prone to falling off production casing as it was run 
through the wellhead, which could cause the casing to become stuck in the middle of the operation.  In the e-mail, 
Mr.  Cocales  explains  the  need  for  centralizers,  but  ultimately  agrees  with  John  Guide’s  conclusion  that  using  only  6  
centralizers was an acceptable risk: 

Even  if  the  hole  is  perfectly  straight,  a  straight  piece  of  pipe  even  in  tension  will  not  seek  the 
perfect center of the hole unless it has something to centralize it.   
 
But,  who  cares,  it’s  done,  end  of  story,  will  probably  be  fine  and  we’ll  get  a  good  cement  job.    I  
would rather have to squeeze than get stuck above the WH [wellhead].  So [John] Guide is right 
on the risk/reward equation. 

 

 

TREX  1517  at  2  (emphasis  added).    “Squeeze”  refers   to  a  “squeeze  job,”  a  term   for  remedial  cement   work.      If  
cement fails to achieve zonal isolation and this failure is detected, a squeeze job can cure the situation.  Therefore, 
Mr.   Cocales’   statement,   “would   rather   have   to   squeeze   than   get   stuck   above   the   [wellhead],”   as   well   as   his  
agreement  with  John  Guide’s  risk/reward  analysis,  reflects  his awareness that using too few centralizers could result 
in a failed cement job.   

71 “Bottoms-up”  refers  to  circulating  mud  in  the  well  such  that  mud  at  the  bottom  is  pumped  back  to  the  rig.    
This has several purposes: remove debris in the well, break the gel strength of mud so it can be displaced, and pump 
mud from the bottom of the well to the surface so it can be evaluated.  According to  the  United  States’  expert  Glen 
Benge, the industry standard is to perform at least one full bottoms-up circulation.  BP’s  internal  standards  required 
at least two full bottoms-up circulations.   
 

BP  decided  to  not  perform  a  full  bottoms-up  prior  to  the  cement  job  because  it  was  concerned  about 
fracturing  the  formation.    While  this  may  have  been  a  legitimate  concern,  its  decision  did  increase  the  risk  of 
channeling,  among  other  things.      A  CBL  would  have  mitigated  this  increased  risk.    Consequently,  BP’s  decision  to  
forego the full bottoms-up should have further motivated it to perform the CBL.    

 

48 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 49 of 153

that there was almost no room for error with regards to cement placement.  Mr. Benge further 

explained it is never the case that cement is placed precisely where intended.  Although BP may 

have  had  a  justifiable  reason  for  pumping  a  low  volume  of  cement—and  the  Court  further 

acknowledges that the amount of cement appears to have met the minimum required by federal 

regulations—this decision did increase the risk that cement would not be properly placed, which 

should have further motivated it to run a CBL.   

194.  The Court recognizes that a CBL is not always run after a cement job.  The Court 

also  acknowledges  that  there  were  indications  that  the  cement  job  went  as  planned,  although 

none of these showed the cement was placed appropriately.  As Dr. Beck explained, however, 

“Successfully  placing  cement  in  the  annular  space  to  achieve zonal isolation is one of the most 

unpredictable tasks faced during the drilling of any well, even more so on a well as unstable as 

was  the  Macondo.    The  need  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  cement  placement  is  obvious.”72  

BP had concerns following the attempted float collar conversion and knowingly accepted other 

risks  with  its  cement  job.    Indeed,   Mark   Hafle,   BP’s   senior   drilling   engineer,   told   BP  

investigators   that   he   believed   BP   was   “going   to   get   a   shittie   cemt   [cement]   job”   due   to   its  

decision to use only 6 centralizers.73   

195.  The  Court  finds  that  a  prudent  well  operator  in  BP’s  position,  knowing  what  BP  

knew at the time, would have run a CBL, even if its decision tree concluded otherwise and its 

drilling and cement contractors did not tell it to do so.  The fact that BP did not opt for the CBL 

when the necessary people and equipment were already on location leads the Court to believe

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 50 of 153

BP’s  decision  was  primarily  driven  by  a desire to save time and money, rather than ensuring that 

the well was secure.74   

196. 

If BP had performed the CBL, it would have shown that the top of the cement was 

not  where  it  should  have  been,  which  would  have  given  clear  indication  that  the  cement  was 

placed improperly and extremely unlikely to provide a barrier to flow.  At that point BP could 

have attempted to remediate the cement job before proceeding any further with the temporary 

abandonment.75    Accordingly,  the  Court  finds  that  BP’s   decision   to   not   run  the  CBL  was  a 

substantial cause of the blowout, explosion, and oil spill.   

M57B Sand 

 
viii.
197.  Halliburton  contended  at  trial  that  BP  did  not  properly  identify  the  “uppermost 

hydrocarbon-bearing zone,” and, because of this failure, the as-designed placement and volume 

of the cement was too low.76  Halliburton contended that the M57B sand was actually the highest 

hydrocarbon-bearing zone. 

198.  The  Court  is  not  persuaded  by  Halliburton’s  argument. 

199.  Notably, there is no evidence that any hydrocarbons flowed from M57B when the 

Macondo well became underbalanced with respect to the M57B zone.   

200.  The Court doubts that the  M57B  sand  was  the  “uppermost hydrocarbon-bearing 

zone.”  In any respect, the Court is certain that the M57B sand was not a cause of the blowout.   

                                                 

74 According  to  BP’s  Greg  Walz,  running  the  CBL   would  have  taken  approximately  10-12 hours and  would 
have  cost  around  $128,000  to  run  plus  about  $400,000  for  Schlumberger’s time.  Schlumberger estimated the cost of 
the CBL to be less than $200,000.   

75 See supra note 70 (discussing  “squeeze  job”).     
76 Halliburton’s  argument  stems  from  30  C.F.R.  §  250.421(e),   which  required  that  annular  cement  be  placed  

“500  feet  above  the  uppermost  hydrocarbon-bearing  zone.”

Cement Composition 
 
201.  Under the contract between Halliburton and BP, Halliburton was responsible for 

Cementing Responsibilities 

making  recommendations  to  BP  regarding  cement  slurry  design  and  job  execution.    Indeed, 

Halliburton  holds  itself  out  as  one  of  the  world’s  leaders  in  cementing  services.     

202.  However, 

the  Halliburton-BP   contract   made   clear  

that   Halliburton’s  

recommendations   “shall   be   received   by   [BP]   as   opinions   only,   and   no   warranty   expressed   or  

implied  shall  be  inferred  by  [BP]  from  such  recommendations  .  .  .  .”77  BP’s  internal  documents  

similarly state: 

Cement design and execution plays a key role in the well construction process and 
subsequent life of well integrity.  A fundamental knowledge of how to design a 
cement job, coupled with an understanding of how to effectively execute a cement 
job is a core competency expected of any drilling engineer.  Reliance on service 
company expertise is unacceptable.78   
 
203. 

It   was   BP’s   responsibility   to   review   Halliburton’s   recommendations   regarding  

cement  design  and  procedure,  and  it  was  ultimately  BP’s  responsibility to determine whether the 

slurry design was appropriate for the well.  In fact, BP had its own cementing specialist, Erick 

Cunningham,  who  reviewed  Halliburton’s  recommendation for the Macondo well. 

204.  Once BP approved a cement recommendation, Halliburton would mix the cement 

and pump it down the well.  Halliburton was also responsible for testing the cement. 

The Cement Design for the Macondo Well 

 
ii.
205.  BP asked Halliburton employee Jessie Gagliano to recommend a cement design to 

be pumped into the production interval for the Macondo well.  Mr. Gagliano recommended using 

a  “foamed”  cement.    BP  reviewed  and  accepted  this  recommendation. 

                                                 

77 TREX 4477 ¶ 29.3.   
78 TREX 37005 at 11.

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 52 of 153

206.  Foamed (or nitrified) cement is created by injecting nitrogen into a base cement 

slurry while it is being pumped into a well.   

207.  Foamed  cement  has  a  number  of  characteristics  that  could  be  useful  for  the 

cement  job  at  Macondo:    Injecting  nitrogen  into  cement  decreases  its  density.    Thus,  a  given 

volume of foamed cement is lighter than the same amount of conventional, unfoamed  cement.  

Lighter  cement  is  useful  when  there  is  a  concern  about  damaging  fragile  rock  formations,  as 

there was at Macondo.  Also, the amount of nitrogen pumped into the cement can be adjusted as 

the cement is pumped into the well, providing more control over cement density. Foamed cement 

is  more  efficient  than  unfoamed  cement  at  displacing  drilling  mud,  which  can  contaminate 

cement   and   harm   its   ability   to   harden   and/or   develop   strength.      Notably,   BP’s   concern   about  

fracturing the formation drove it to limit pump rates during the cement job (as it did during the 

attempted  float  collar  conversion);  thus,  the  enhanced  displacement  ability  of  foamed  cement 

would,  at  least  in  theory,  mitigate  the  increased  risks  of  mud  contamination.    Finally,  the 

pressurized nitrogen bubbles in foamed cement make it more resistant to gas migration as the 

cement transitions from liquid to solid.     

208.  However, the benefits of foamed cement are only obtained if the foam is stable.     

A stable foam cement is one in which nitrogen bubbles remain evenly distributed throughout the 

slurry  after  nitrogen  has  been  injected.    An  unstable  cement  design  is  one  in  which  nitrogen 

migrates   or   “breaks   out”  of  the  slurry  and/or  does  not  stay  evenly  distributed  throughout  the 

slurry. 

209.  The DEEPWATER HORIZON already had some cement on board left over from 

its previous job at the Kodiak well (“the  Kodiak  cement”).  Halliburton recommended that BP 

use this cement for the Macondo well.  BP accepted this recommendation as well.  

 

52 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 53 of 153

210.  The evidence reflects that Halliburton did not have a financial incentive to use the 

leftover  Kodiak  cement  at  the  Macondo  well.    BP  purchased  the  Kodiak  cement  from 

Halliburton before the HORIZON arrived at Macondo.  Mr. Gagliano testified that, if anything, 

there was financial motivation for Halliburton to sell BP new cement for the Macondo job, rather 

than  use   the   left   over   Kodiak   cement.         Tom  Roth,   Halliburton’s   vice   president   of   cementing  

products  service  line  in  2010,  further  testified  that  if  the  Kodiak  cement  was  not  used  at 

Macondo,  BP  would  bear  the  cost  of  disposing  of  the  Kodiak  cement,  as  well  as  the  costs 

associated  with  purchasing  new  cement  and  transporting  it  to  the  HORIZON.    Mr.  Roth  also 

explained  that  Halliburton’s  policy  was  that  it  did  not  accept returns of unused cement.   

211.  Based on the above, the Court finds that BP had a financial incentive to use the 

leftover Kodiak cement at the Macondo well.   

212.  The  Kodiak  cement  was  not  intended  to  be  foamed.    The  Kodiak  cement 

contained a defoamer, D-Air 3000, which is added to break up air in the cement and give it a 

smoother density going downhole.  A defoamer like D-Air 3000 can destabilize foamed cement.   

213.  SCR-100, a retarder additive that lengthens the time it takes for cement to thicken 

in  order  to  allow  sufficient  time  to  place  the  cement,  was  added  to  the  cement  used  in  the 

Macondo well.  SCR-100 also can destabilize foam cement slurries.   

Parties’  Arguments  Regarding  Cement  Composition 

 
iii.
214.  BP contends that the D-Air 3000, and to a lesser extent the SCR-100, caused the 

foamed  cement  to  become  unstable,  and  this  is  why  the  cement  failed  to  achieve  zonal 

isolation.79  In other words, BP claims the cement recommended by Halliburton was inherently 

defective.     

                                                 

79 The PSC, Alabama, and Louisiana, agree with BP that the cement failed because it was inherently unstable, 
not because it  was improperly placed.  Transocean also believes the cement  was  inherently defective, but it  also 

 

53 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 54 of 153

215.  Specifically, BP believes nitrogen broke out of the foamed cement pumped into 

the annulus.  This created pockets in the cement through which hydrocarbons could and did flow.  

BP further contends that the unfoamed tail cement placed in the shoe track should have created a 

secondary barrier, but the nitrogen breakout contaminated the unfoamed shoe track cement, or, 

alternatively,  the  hydrocarbon  influx  reached  the  shoe  track  before  the  tail  cement  had  fully 

transitioned from liquid to solid.    

216.  BP further claims that Halliburton and Jesse Gagliano knew that defoamers like 

D-Air  3000  should  not  be  used  with  foamed  cement.    BP  also  contends  that  Halliburton’s  pre-

incident tests indicated that the cement would be unstable, but Halliburton did not share these 

results with BP.   

217.  Halliburton asserts, somewhat half-heartedly, that the foamed cement was stable.  

Instead,  Halliburton’s  main  theme  at  trial  was  that  any  instability  was  not  the  reason  the  cement  

failed  to  achieve  zonal  isolation  or  that  the  blowout  occurred.    This  theme  manifests  itself  in 

various arguments.  As discussed above, Halliburton argues that the cement failed because it was 

pumped through a breach in the shoe track and therefore was not placed across the hydrocarbon 

bearing  sands  below  the  breach  point.    Alternatively,  if  the  shoe  track  was  not  breached, 

Halliburton  contends  that  BP  made  several  decisions  that  resulted  in  channeling,  which  also 

would cause the cement job to fail.80  If the cement was unstable, Halliburton asserts that the 

result  is  denser  cement,  not  permeable  cement.    Halliburton  additionally  claims  that  any 

                                                                                                                                                             
contends there were a number of other factors for which BP is wholly responsible that  also caused the cement to 
become unstable and/or otherwise fail.   

80 According to Halliburton, these decisions included not using enough centralizers and not performing a full 
bottoms-up circulation prior to pumping cement.  Halliburton also claims that BP’s  decision  to  use  low  pump  rates  
decreased the displacement efficiency of the cement and the spacer pumped ahead of it, leaving mud and/or debris in 
the annulus.  This could lead to channeling, instability, or both.   

 

54 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 55 of 153

instability was due to decisions made by BP and/or risks knowingly assumed by BP.81  Finally, 

Halliburton  points  out  that  it  is  not  uncommon for  cement  jobs  to  fail, and  when  this  occurs, 

remedial  cementing  work  can  be  performed.    Halliburton  claims  that  if  BP  had  not 

misinterpreted  the  negative  pressure  test  on  April  20,  2010,  the  cement  failure—whatever  its 

cause—could have been fixed and the blowout avoided. 

218.  The   United   States   and   Transocean   repeat   many   of   Halliburton’s   arguments.  

Either or both of these parties add that (1) if the float collar had converted, which BP failed to 

verify, the blowout would not have occurred; (2) BP did not allow sufficient time for the cement 

to set up before conducting the negative pressure test; (3) BP decided not to place a heavy pill in 

the rat hole (the short length of drilled out hole  below the  reamer shoe), which permitted the 

heavy  cement  in  the  shoe  track  to  switch  places  with  the  lighter  drilling  mud  in  the  rat  hole, 

contaminating the shoe track cement and providing a pathway for hydrocarbons up the wellbore; 

(4) BP pumped a lightweight base oil spacer ahead of the cement in an effort to avoid fracturing 

the well, which likely mixed with the foamed cement and caused it to become unstable; and  (5) 

BP proceeded with the cement job without a successful foam stability test.

The Cement Was Unstable, but Instability Did Not Cause the Blowout  

 
219.  The  Court  has  concluded  that  cement  was  not  properly  placed  either  in  the 

annulus or in the shoe track due to a breach in the shoe track.  Given this conclusion, even if the 

                                                 

81 The synthetic oil based mud used at Macondo  can  destabilize  foamed  cement.    BP’s  own  in-house cement 
expert  Erick  Cunningham  warned  BP  about  the  risk  of  using  foamed  cement  in  this  environment.    Halliburton 
argues that, while it is not uncommon to use foamed cement in such an environment, BP’s  decision  to  use  low  pump  
rates increased the chances that the cement would be contaminated by synthetic oil based mud.  Halliburton also 
points out that BP decided to increase the concentration of SCR-100 retarder in the cement, and BP understood that 
this would increase the risk of nitrogen breakout.  With respect to D-Air 3000, Halliburton contends that BP knew 
that the Kodiak cement contained D-Air,  and  Jesse  Gagliano  told  BP’s  Mark  Hafle  and  Brian  Morel  in  an  e-mail 
dated  December  7,  2009,  that  D-Air  should  not  be  used  with  foamed  cement.  Halliburton  also  claims  that  the 
destabilizing effects of D-Air 3000 on foamed cement can be countered by adding surfactant to the cement slurry.  
Jesse Gagliano used ZoneSealant 2000, a surfactant, with the cement slurry; for that reason Halliburton claims his 
recommendation to use cement containing D-Air 3000 was not unreasonable.

cement pumped down the well was stable and fully capable of providing a barrier to flow, the 

cement would not have achieved zonal isolation.   

220.  The Court will put its conclusion aside for the moment and assume that no breach 

in the shoe track occurred and the cement was properly placed in the annulus and shoe track.  

221.  Under this assumption, the Court finds that the cement was unstable and nitrogen 

broke  out  of  the  slurry.    The  reason  this  occurred  was  due  to  a  combination  of  factors:  the 

defoamer (D-Air 3000) and the increased retarder (SCR-100) in the cement. 

222.  Using  cement  with  D-Air  3000  certainly  increased  the  risk  of  instability  and 

nitrogen   breakout.      Notably,   Halliburton’s   internal   procedures  advised  against  this  practice.  

However, the fact that D-Air 3000 was included in the cement did not guarantee that the cement 

would  be  unstable.    Glen  Benge,  expert  for  the  United  States,  testified  that  the  effects  of  a 

defoamer  like  D-Air  3000  can  be  overcome  by  adding  sufficient  amounts  of  surfactant.  

Halliburton’s   Jesse   Gagliano   added   ZoneSealant   2000,   a   surfactant,   to   the   Kodiak   cement.      

Although most pre-incident tests indicated the cement was unstable, one showed the slurry might 

be  stable  (although  Mr.  Benge  stated  that  he  would  conduct  further  testing,  given  that  the 

resulting cement had higher density than intended).  This opens the door to the possibility that D-

Air 3000 did not cause instability at Macondo or that it was not the sole cause of instability.  

223.  As  Mr.  Benge  explained,  the  inclusion  of  D-Air  3000  placed  heightened 

importance on cement testing.  The Court finds that BP knew that the cement contained D-Air 

3000,  and  BP  understood  that  D-Air  3000  increased  the  risk  of  destabilization.82    The  only 

                                                 

82 A number of communications from Halliburton to BP stated that D-Air 3000 was in the cement.  There is 
much evidence  showing that  BP  was  knowledgeable in cement  matters; therefore the  Court infers that BP likely 
understood that D-Air 3000 was a defoamer that increased the chance of instability in foamed cement.  Furthermore, 
an e-mail from Jesse Gagliano to Mark Hafle and Brian Morel on December 7, 2009, stated that leftover cement on 
the   MARIANAS   (the   first   rig   to   drill   at   Macondo)   “cannot   be   used   when   foaming   because   of   the   D-Air  in  the 
blend.”    TREX  7489.

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 57 of 153

cement test BP received prior to the incident indicated instability, or at best was inconclusive and 

needed  to  be  reconducted.    Nevertheless,  BP  moved  forward  with  the  cement  job  despite  the 

absence of a successful foam stability test.   

224.  Regarding the cement retarder, SCR-100, on April 18 BP directed Halliburton to 

increase the concentration of retarder from 8 to 9 gallons per 100 sacks of cement.83  Mr. Benge 

testified that enough retarder can create instability in foam cement.  BP and Halliburton knew 

that  increasing  the  concentration  of  retarder,  SCR-100,  increased  the  risk  of  instability  and 

nitrogen breakout.  Notably, BP drilling engineer Brian Morel told BP Wells Team Leader John 

Guide in an e-mail dated April 17, 2010, that he preferred to use 9 gallons of retarder over 8 

gallons,  “with the added risk of having issues with the nitrogen.” 84 

225.  As  with  the  D-Air  3000,  BP  pumped  the  cement  job  without  having  any  test 

results on the cement with the 9 gallon concentration of SCR-100.  In fact, Brian Morel noted in 

his April 17 e-mail  with  John  Guide  that  “[t]here  isn’t  a  compressive  strength  development  yet  

[on the 9 gallon concentration],  so  it’s  hard  to  ensure  we  will  get  what  we  need  until it’s  done.”  

This further shows that BP understood that testing was essential to mitigate the risks associated 

with this cement.  Nevertheless, BP proceeded to pump the cement without any test results.     

226.  The Court finds that the D-Air 3000 and the SCR-100 both caused destabilization 

and nitrogen breakout.  BP and Halliburton share blame for this.   

227.  Halliburton failed its testing obligation.  It was slow to perform tests and did not 

disclose the results of all of the pre-incident tests it did run.   

                                                 

83 Again,  BP’s  concern  about  fracturing  the  formation  drove  this  decision.    BP  wanted to use low pump rates 
during the cement job in order to avoid damaging the formation, which meant it would take longer for the cement to 
be pumped into place.  BP increased the retarder concentration in order to keep the cement in a liquid state longer 
and compensate for the added pump time.    

84 At  trial  Mr.  Guide  provided  a  different  interpretation  of  Brian  Morel’s  e-mail than the one given above.  The 

Court  finds  that  Mr.  Guide’s  interpretation  lacks  credibility. 
57 

 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 58 of 153

228.  Notably,   BP’s   Brian   Morel   complained   to   Mark   Hafle   on   April   18,   2010,  that 

Jesse  Gagliano  “waited  until  the  last  minute”  to  perform  cement  testing, which prevented the BP 

engineering   team   from   “tweak[ing]   the   slurry   to   meet   our   needs.”      Mr.   Morel   concluded  that 

“Jesse  isn’t  cutting  it  any  more.”85  

229. 

Jesse Gagliano knew or should have known that D-Air 3000 and SCR-100 could 

cause instability.  Jesse Gagliano knew or should have known that the results of the pre-incident 

stability tests were questionable at best and indicated failure at worst.  Halliburton should have 

voiced concern to BP.   

230.  Halliburton’s   conduct   does   not   excuse   BP’s   actions.      BP  understood  the 

importance of foam stability testing and had specifically requested the test results from Gagliano.  

BP  never  received  test  results  on  the  specific  cement  pumped  at  Macondo  prior  to  April  20, 

2010.  The pre-incident test results BP did receive prior to April 20 indicated instability.  This 

should have given BP pause.  Instead, BP pressed forward without a successful foam stability 

test.   

231.  As   mentioned   at   the   outset   of   this   discussion,   given   the   Court’s   finding   that  

cement  was  not  appropriately  placed  across  all  of  the  hydrocarbon-bearing   zones,   the   Court’s  

findings regarding the instability of the cement makes little difference, at least with respect to 

identifying the cause of the blowout.  No cement, no matter how well designed and stable, will 

achieve zonal isolation if not properly placed.  Furthermore, assuming the cement was properly 

placed, the Court is  not convinced that the tail cement in the shoe track  would have failed to 

provide  a  barrier  to  hydrocarbon  flow,  as  BP’s  theory  requires.

232.  Therefore,  the  Court  ultimately  concludes  that  while  the  foamed  cement  was 

unstable, this was not a cause of the blowout.  Improper placement of the cement was the reason 

the production casing cement job failed to achieve zonal isolation, which led to the blowout.  
H. 

Pressure Integrity Testing 
 
233.  Pumping the production casing cement concluded around 12:30 a.m. on April 19, 

i.

The Positive  Pressure Test 

2010.    

234.  Between  10:55  a.m.  and  noon  on  April  20,  2010,  the  rig  crew  conducted  a 

positive pressure test.  This test is intended to verify that the well casing is intact and does not 

leak.  To perform this test, the blind shear rams in the BOP were closed.86  Additional fluid was 

then pumped into the well below the blind shear rams, which raised the pressure in the well.   If 

the  wellbore  holds  this  pressure,  it  indicates  the  casing  has  integrity.    If  pressure  begins  to 

decline, it indicates fluid is leaking out of the well, possibly due to a breach or gap in the casing.  

The positive pressure test was performed in two stages: a low-pressure test and a high-pressure 

test.  The wellbore held 250 psi for 5 minutes and then 2680 psi for 30 minutes.  The test was 

deemed successful. 

235.  Notably, the positive pressure test did not test whether the float collar converted, 

the  integrity  of  the  casing  below  the  float  collar  (i.e.,  the  shoe  track),  or  the  integrity  of  the 

cement placed in the shoe track or in the annulus.  This is because a cement displacement wiper 

plug that had been placed on top of the float collar at the end of the cementing operation isolated 

the float collar, shoe track, and annulus from the positive pressure test.  Thus, a breach in the 

shoe track would not be revealed by the positive pressure test.   

                                                 

86 The blind shear rams are one of the sealing elements in the BOP.  See infra Part III.J.i.  The drill pipe was not 
in the BOP when the blind shear rams were closed for the positive pressure test, thus, the rams did not have to shear 
through pipe at this time.  They merely closed on themselves.

The Negative Pressure Test 

 
ii.
236.  Although  MMS  regulations  at  the  time  did  not  explicitly  require  a  negative 

pressure test, no party disputes that it is a safety-critical test.  In the words of Dr. Beck,  “The  

negative  pressure  test  is  the  most  critical  test  that  is  run  prior  to  removing  the  blowout 

preventer.”87   

237.  The negative pressure test was intended to simulate the hydrostatic condition on 

the well after temporary abandonment; i.e., after the HORIZON departed along with its BOP, the 

riser, and the heavy drilling mud in the riser and upper well casing.  The goal of the test is to 

confirm the integrity of the entire system, including the casing, cement outside the casing, and 

cement in the shoe track.  

238.  During the test,  some of the mud  is displaced with a lighter fluid such that the 

well becomes underbalanced; i.e., the pore pressure in the formation is greater than the pressure 

inside  the  casing.88    Once  the  appropriate  amount  of  mud  has  been  displaced,  any  built  up 

pressure is bled out of the well casing.  The negative pressure test can then be accomplished by 

monitoring  pressure  or  by  monitoring  for  flow  from  the  well  to  the  rig.    Under  the  pressure 

method, if pressure remains at zero, it indicates that the well is secure.  If pressure increases, it 

indicates that something, such as hydrocarbons, is flowing into what should be a closed system.  

Under the flow method, one or more apertures at the top of the system on the rig are left open 

after pressure is bled to zero.  If fluid thereafter flows out of the pipe opening(s), it indicates the 

well is not secure; something is flowing into the well that is forcing fluid out at the top.  If the 

                                                 

87 TREX 8140 at 93 (Beck Expert Report). 
88 A variety of fluids can be used to displace the heavier mud.  In the case of Macondo, seawater was used.  The 
amount of drilling fluid that is displaced for a negative pressure test varies as well.  The test at Macondo intended 
that the drilling  mud from the top  of the BOP to a depth of 8,367 feet (3,367 feet below the seafloor)  would be 
displaced to seawater.  Mud would still occupy the riser above the BOP and the well below 8,367 feet.

negative pressure test indicates that the well is not secure, the well can be kept under control by 

adding mud and regaining hydrostatic overbalance, and/or by using the BOP to shut in the well. 

239.  All of the experts agreed that the criteria for a successful negative pressure test are 

easily understood in the drilling industry: once the pressure is bled down to zero, the pressure 

must remain at zero if the test is conducted by monitoring pressure gauges.  If the test is a flow 

check, then no fluids should flow from the open aperture.  If there is either pressure or flow, then 

the test has failed.  In the words of Richard Heenan, expert witness for the United States, this is a 

“pass-fail”   test.      As   Transocean   expert   Calvin   Barnhill   testified,   “This   isn’t   baseball,   the   tie  

doesn’t   go   to   the   runner,  the   tie   goes   to   the   failed   test.      So   if   it’s   good,   it’s   good;;   if   it’s  

inconclusive  or  if  it’s  bad,  it’s  not  a  good  test.”89

Note that the pressure gauges on the drill pipe and the kill line90 indicate zero pressure.

241.  The negative pressure test at Macondo, which should have been completed in a 

relatively  short  time,  instead  was  conducted  over  three  hours  from  4:55  p.m.  to  7:55  p.m.  on 

April 20, 2010.   

                                                 

90 The kill line is a pipe that runs from the rig to the BOP, outside the riser.   Like the drill pipe, fluids can be 

pumped down the kill line or they can flow up it.

242. 

 The reason for the unusually long time was that anomalous pressure readings and 

other  phenomena  occurred  during  the  test.    Rather  than  discuss  each  anomaly,  the  Court  will 

focus  on  the  critical  and  overriding  aspect  of  the  negative  pressure  test.    Accordingly,  with 

respect to drill pipe pressures and various other data relevant to the three hours during which the 

negative  pressure  test  was  performed,  the  data  set  out  in  BP’s   Accident   Investigation   Report  

shall be generally accepted for purposes of these findings.92  

243.  The negative pressure test was initially conducted by monitoring pressure on the 

drill  pipe,  which  was  the  normal  and  preferred  practice  for  the  Transocean  drill  crew.    By 

approximately  5:30  p.m.,  there  were  significant  anomalies  that  should  have  indicated  that  the 

well potentially was in communication with the reservoir, or at least that the test had failed and 

needed to be restarted.  Instead of declaring the test a failure, however, the BP Well Site Leaders 

concluded  that  the  test  needed  to  be  conducted  on  the  kill  line,  rather  than  the  drill  pipe.93  

Accordingly, BP Well Site Leader Don Vidrine ordered the Transocean drill crew to shift the test 

to the kill line and monitor for flow.   

244.  Although the negative pressure test  was  “moved”  to  the  kill  line,  the  Transocean  

drill crew and the BP Well Site Leader continued to monitor pressure readings on the drill pipe.   

245. 

In the process of shifting the test to the kill line, pressure that had built up on the 

drill pipe was bled to near 0.  Between 6:00 p.m. and 6:35 p.m., the drill pipe pressure steadily 

rose to 1,400 psi., where it remained until the negative pressure test concluded around 7:55 p.m.

93 BP asserts that the reason the negative pressure test was shifted to the kill line was because the procedure 
submitted to and approved by the MMS stated the kill line would be used.  At least one expert contested whether 
this was actually the case.  In light of the errors regarding the interpretation of the negative pressure test, whether or 
not the permit required the negative pressure test to be performed on the kill line is a fairly insignificant point.  The 
Court does find, however, that had the test continued on the drill pipe, the test would not have been misinterpreted. 

 

63 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 64 of 153

246.  Around  7:07  p.m.,  the  kill  line  was  opened  at  the  surface  to  bleed  off  some 

pressure.  The kill was then left open and monitored for any flow at the surface.  No fluid was 

observed flowing from the kill line for thirty minutes.  There was also no pressure on the kill 

line.   

247. 

  Around 7:55 p.m. the BP Well Site Leaders declared the negative pressure test a 

success based on the lack of flow from the kill line for thirty minutes.  The Transocean drill crew 

agreed with this conclusion.  However, 1,400 psi pressure remained on the drill pipe at this time.       

248. 

  The one thing the 1,400 psi  reading  absolutely precluded was  a  determination 

that  the  negative  pressure  test  was  successful  or  that  the  well  was  secure.    The  1,400  psi 

indicated that the well was in communication with the formation.  The negative test should have 

been declared a failure.   

249.  Furthermore,  “[w]ith  the  difficulties  of  converting  the  float  collar  and  potential 

damage to the shoe track, there was ample reason to expect well integrity to be suspect, which 

should have heightened attention  even  beyond  the  usual  ‘high  alert’ status required by a negative 

pressure  test.”94  

250.  The lack of flow from and pressure on the kill line was obviously a false reading.  

Something had blocked the kill line such that the pressure that existed in the well and registered 

on  the  drill  pipe  did  not  affect  any  fluid  in  the  kill  line  nor   did   it   register   on   the   kill   line’s  

pressure sensor.   

251.  Having declared the negative pressure test successful, BP Well Site Leader Don 

Vidrine instructed the Transocean drill crew to proceed with displacing the remaining mud in the 

riser above the BOP with seawater.  The drill crew first opened the lower annular preventer in 

the BOP, which had been closed for the negative pressure test in order to isolate the mud in the

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 65 of 153

riser from the well.  This increased the hydrostatic pressure in the well, returning it to a state of 

overbalance.    The drill  crew  then proceeded to  displace all of the mud  above 8,367  feet with 

seawater.  At this point, the drilling mud provided the only barrier to flow.  Consequently, it was 

only a matter of time before the well would again become underbalanced.  As discussed later, 

this would lead to a kick, then a blowout, and, once gas from the well found an ignition source 

on the rig, the first explosion. 

252. 

If  the  negative  pressure  test  had  been  correctly  interpreted,  the  blowout, 

explosion, fire, and oil spill would have been averted.  Consequently, the Court finds that the 

misinterpretation of the negative pressure test was a substantial cause of the blowout, explosion, 

fire, and oil spill.   

Responsibility for Misinterpretation of the Negative Pressure Test  

 
iii.
253.  BP  was  responsible  for  designing  the  procedures  for  the  negative  pressure  test, 

supervising the test, and ultimately determining whether the test was a success.   

254.  The  Transocean  drill  crew  actually  conducted  the  test  and  was  primarily 

responsible for monitoring the well at all times.  The Transocean drill crew also had authority to 

stop  the  work  if  they  had  concerns  about  the  negative  pressure  test  or  felt  that  it  was  not 

successful.  BP could not force the Transocean drill crew to proceed.   

255.  Randy Ezell, Transocean’s senior toolpusher on the HORIZON (who was off duty 

at the time of the blowout) testified that it was typical for the on-duty BP Well Site Leader and 

the on-duty Transocean toolpusher to  discuss  the  results  of  a  negative  pressure  test,  but  that  “it  

was  BP’s  well,  and  he  [the  BP Well Site Leader] had the final say [as to whether the negative 

 

65 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 66 of 153

pressure test was successful or not]. . . . He [the BP Well Site Leader] had the ultimate decision, 

but we had stop-work  authority  if  we  saw  something  wasn’t  correct.”95    

256.  The evidence reflects that both the BP Well Site Leaders and the Transocean drill 

crew were aware of the anomalies that occurred during the negative pressure test, including the 

1,400 psi pressure on the drill pipe, and that these anomalies were discussed between and among 

the BP Well Site Leaders and the Transocean drill crew.  Ultimately, however, both the BP Well 

Site Leaders and the Transocean drill crew agreed that, based on the lack of flow from the kill 

line, the negative pressure test was successful and the well was secure.   

257.  The BP Well Site Leaders and the Transocean drill crew incorrectly attributed the 

pressure on the drill pipe to a so-called “bladder  effect.”    As  explained later, this phenomenon is 

not  known  to  exist  in  the  context  of  negative  pressure  tests,  and  no  party  has  advanced  the 

“bladder  effect”  as  a  plausible  explanation  for  the  pressure  anomaly  during  the  negative  pressure  

test.   

258.  Accordingly, both BP and Transocean are responsible for the misinterpretation of 

the negative pressure test.   

259.  Notably,  BP  Exploration  and  Production,  Inc.  and  Transocean  Deepwater  Inc. 

admitted as much when they pled guilty to certain crimes arising from the incident.   

260.  BP Exploration and Production, Inc. admitted:  

The  [BP]  Well  Site  Leaders  were  responsible  for  supervising  the  negative 
pressure test conducted by Transocean. . . .  
 
[T]he negative pressure test performed on the Macondo Well provided multiple 
indications that the wellbore  was  not  secure.    BP’s  Well  Site  Leaders negligently 
supervised the negative pressure test during this time, failed to alert engineers on 
the  shore  of  these  indications,  and  along  with  others,  ultimately  deemed  the 
negative pressure test a success, all in violation of the applicable duty of care.  . . .

BP’s   negligent   conduct,   among   others,   was   a   proximate   cause   of   the   deaths   of  
eleven men and pollution resulting from the Macondo Well blowout.96 

261.  Transocean Deepwater Inc. admitted: 

TRANSCOEAN, together with BP, conducted negative testing on the Macondo 
well.  . . .  

.  .  .  Both  BP  and  defendant  TRANSOCEAN  continued  to  observe  abnormal 
pressure on the drill pipe while monitoring the kill line for flow.   . . .  BP and 
defendant TRANSOCEAN did not take further steps to investigate the source of 
the  abnormal  drill  pipe  pressure,  which  was  neither  correctly  explained  nor 
remediated.   
. . .  
Defendant   TRANSOCEAN’s   conduct   violated   its   duty   to   exercise   well  
 
control  in  accordance  with  the  standard  of  care  applicable  in  the  deepwater  oil 
exploration industry.  
 

Defendant   TRANSOCEAN’s   negligent   conduct,  

the  
negligent  conduct  of  others,  was  a  proximate  cause  of  the  blowout  and  the 
discharge of certain quantities of oil and natural gas from the Macondo well into 
the Gulf of Mexico.97    

together   with  

262.  Although both are to blame for the misinterpretation of the negative pressure test, 

 

 

 

the Court finds BP is more culpable than Transocean.   

263.  As  already  noted,  BP  was  ultimately  responsible  for  declaring  the  negative 

pressure test a success or failure.    

264.  BP had multiple onshore technical personnel at  the  Well  Site  Leaders’ disposal to 

assist in resolving issues with the negative pressure test, and, in fact, Well Site Leader Vidrine 

discussed the negative pressure test with one of these onshore engineers.   

265.  Between 8:52 p.m. and 9:02 p.m.—after the negative pressure test concluded but 

before the blowout—Well Site Leader Vidrine (on the rig) and BP Senior Engineer Mark Hafle

(in  Houston)  had  a  phone  conversation  during  which  they  discussed,  among  other  things,  the 

negative pressure test.     

266.  Neither  Vidrine  nor  Hafle  testified  at  trial.    However,  on  July  8,  2010,  in  the 

presence of his own attorneys and BP in-house counsel, Hafle was interviewed by members of 

the BP incident investigation team.  The interview notes state in relevant part: 

Don Vidrine called Mark [Hafle] at 8:52 pm to talk about how to test the surface 
plug and whether they should apply a pressure test or a weight test. Mark noted 
that Don also talked to him about the negative tests. Vidrine told Mark that the 
crew had zero pressure on the kill line, but that they still had pressure on the 
drill pipe.  Mark  said  he  told  Don  that  you  can’t  have  pressure  on  the  drill  pipe  
and zero pressure on  the  kill  line  in  a  test  that’s  properly  lined  up. Mark said 
that he told Don he might consider whether he had trapped pressure in the line or 
perhaps he didn’t  have  a  valve  properly  lined  up.  Don  told  Mark  that  he  was  fully  
satisfied that the rig crew had performed a successful negative test. Mark said he 
didn’t  have  the  full  context  for  what  had  transpired  during  the  tests  and  it  wasn’t  
clear to him whether Don was talking about the first or second negative tests. Don 
told him he watched the kill line for  30  minutes  and  didn’t  see  a  drip  come  out  of  
it; and so Mark assumed that Don had concluded that it was not a problem.98 

267.  The  foregoing  document  sets  forth  an  exchange  between  the  most  senior  BP 

 

representative  on  the  rig  and  BP’s  senior  drilling  engineer in Houston.  The document and related 

testimony  establish  that  Mr.  Hafle  understood  that  the  negative  pressure  test  could  not  be 

considered a success given the two inconsistent pressures on the kill line and drill pipe.  As the 

United  States’  expert described it,  “someone  on  the  shore  side  of  BP  said,  ‘This  isn’t  right.’”99 

268.  Mark Hafle not only recognized that the test could not be considered a success, he 

was advising Vidrine how to troubleshoot the  problem:  “Mark  said  that  he  told  Don  he  might  

consider  whether  he  had  trapped  pressure  in  the  line  or  perhaps  he  didn’t  have  a  valve  properly  

lined  up.”

269.  The interview notes  also establish that   BP’s  Senior  Drilling  Engineer  expressly  

told Vidrine, the same Well Site Leader who had approved the negative pressure test only an 

hour before, that the test could not be considered a success given the two inconsistent pressures 

on the kill line and drill pipe. 

270.  The  time  of  the  call  is  significant.    BP  contends  that  hydrocarbons  entered  the 

wellbore at 8:52 p.m.  This means that the call between Vidrine and Hafle commenced at the 

same time that the well went underbalanced and began to flow.  The conversation ended at 9:02 

p.m.  One  of  BP’s experts stated that hydrocarbons did not pass the BOP and enter the riser until 

approximately 9:38 p.m.  This means there were 36 minutes after the phone call to close in the 

well and prevent hydrocarbons from getting above the BOP.   

271. 

If  anyone  at  BP  had  instructed  Transocean’s   drill   crew   to   re-run  the  negative 

pressure test immediately after the call concluded at 9:02, or even within the next half hour, the 

drill  crew’s  first step would have been to stop the mud pumps and close the annular preventer in 

the  BOP.    These  actions  alone  would  have  secured  the  well  and  prevented  the  kick  from 

escalating into a blowout.  Upon determining that the well was not secure, the drill crew would 

have  been  in  a  position  to  circulate  the  well  back  to  drilling  mud  and  return  it  to  state  of 

overbalance.   The blowout would have been avoided.    

272.  Halliburton’s  expert, Dr. Beck, testified that Hafle should have stopped operations 

upon hearing about the 1,400 psi pressure on the drill pipe.100   

273.  BP  contends  that  Mark  Hafle  was  not  sure  if  Don  Vidrine,  in  describing  the 

different pressures on the drill pipe and the kill line, was describing the initial test on the drill 

pipe or the later test on the kill line, based on the following excerpt from the interview notes:

Mark  said  he  didn’t  have  the  full  context  for  what  had transpired during the tests 
and   it   wasn’t   clear   to   him   whether   Don   was   talking   about   the  first  or  second 
negative tests.  Don told him he watched the kill line for 30 minutes and didn’t 
see a drip come out of it; and so Mark assumed that Don had concluded that it 
was not a problem. 

274.  Even if Hafle did not have the full context as to which negative pressure test the 

 

Well Site Leader was referring to, the Court credits the common sense testimony of witnesses 

who stated that if the Senior Drilling Engineer did not have all the information needed, then he 

needed to get that information in order to satisfy himself.  As Mr. Heenan explained, if Hafle 

lacked context, then he only needed to ask Vidrine which test he was talking about.  Hafle also 

could have looked at the data that was running on his desk computer in Houston, which could 

display pressure and flow data from the well in real time or as it occurred during the negative 

pressure test.101   

275.  Furthermore, it is inexplicable that Hafle did not take further action given that he 

believed  the  design  of  the  cement  job  was  “on   [the]   ragged   edge”   and   that  BP  would  get  a 

“shittie” cement job.102  Mr. Hafle also knew of the problems BP encountered with converting 

the float collar and the anomalous data that followed.   

276.  But  even  if  Hafle  lacked  context,  Don  Vidrine  did  not.    The  Well  Site  Leader 

already had firsthand knowledge of the negative pressure test that he himself approved an hour 

before.   Furthermore,  Vidrine stated in post-incident interviews that the  negative pressure test 

results   looked   “squirrely”   to   him  and  that   he   was   “concerned”   about   the   pressure   on   the   drill  

pipe.103  If  these  statements  accurately  represent  Vidrine’s  beliefs  on  April  20, 2010, then when 

Hafle  provided  the  information  Vidrine  already  was  obligated  to  know  as  a  matter  of 

fundamental well control—“you  can’t  have  pressure  on  the  drill  pipe  and  zero  pressure  on  the

kill  line  in  a  test  that’s   properly   lined   up”—Vidrine  should  not  have  hesitated  to  order  the 

Transocean drill crew to stop the displacement, shut in the well, and redo the negative pressure 

test.   

277.  However, Vidrine did not order another negative pressure test after the phone call. 

Nor does any evidence indicate that Vidrine discussed the phone call with the Transocean crew.   

Instead, at 9:14 p.m. Mr. Vidrine affirmatively ordered that the pumps—which had stopped at 

9:08 p.m. so a sheen test could be performed—be restarted and that displacement continue.  He 

did this with the critical information the BP Senior Drilling Engineer had provided to him only 

minutes earlier.   

278. 

It is also noted that  BP’s Accident Investigation Report did not mention the 8:52 

p.m. phone call between Vidrine and Hafle, and in fact states, “The  investigation  team  has  found  

no evidence that the rig crew or well site leaders consulted anyone outside their team about the 

pressure abnormality.”104  This statement is patently false.  As reflected in the BP  investigators’  

notes and as members of the investigation team admitted at trial, the BP investigation team was 

aware of the 8:52 p.m. phone call. 

279.  The person in charge of BP’s investigation and report, Mark Bly, testified that the 

reason the report did not mention the 8:52 phone call is because the call was  “after  the  fact,  after  

the   test   had   been   accepted.”105    Steve  Robinson,  a  member  of  the  BP  investigation  team, 

similarly  testified  that  the  call  was  not  included  in  BP’s  report  because  he  “didn’t  see  it  as  being  

causal because the interpretation of  the  test  wasn’t  done  in  this  call.”106   As discussed above, 

however, there were 36 minutes between the time the phone call ended and hydrocarbons entered 

the riser.  That was plenty of time for Vidrine or Hafle to stop the displacement and order that the

negative test be performed again.  The opportunity to avoid disaster had not yet passed.   The 

explanations provided by Messrs. Bly and Robinson are untenable.   

280.  The  Court  infers  that   BP’s  investigation  team  recognized  the  importance  of  the  

8:52 p.m. phone call and chose to omit it from the BP Accident Investigation Report to avoid 

casting further blame on BP.   

281.  With respect to the Transocean drill crew, the Court finds that they were attentive 

to  the  well  during  the  negative  pressure  test  and  took  the  procedure  seriously.    BP  suggests 

otherwise based on comments Vidrine made during interviews with BP investigators following 

the incident.107  The Court gives little weight to these statements.    Witnesses,  including  BP’s  Lee 

Lambert, testified that the Transocean drill crew worked seriously on the negative pressure test 

and had detailed discussions about the pressure anomalies as they tried to resolve them.   Data 

from the well confirms that the crew took actions to investigate and troubleshoot some of the 

anomalies they encountered during this time.   

282.  Finally,  the  Court  finds  that  BP’s  conduct  with  respect  to  the  negative  pressure  

test violated several MMS regulations, including 30  C.F.R.  §  107(a)  (“You  must  protect  health,  

safety,  property,  and  the  environment  by  .  .  .  [p]erforming  all  operations  in  a  safe  and 

workmanlike  manner”),  30  C.F.R.  §  250.300  (a)  (“The  lessee  shall  not  create  conditions  that  will  

pose  unreasonable  risk  to  public  health,  life,  property,  aquatic  life,  wildlife,  recreation, 

navigation, commercial  fishing,  or  other  uses  of  the  ocean.”),  and  30  C.F.R.  §  250.401(a)  (“You  

must take necessary precaution to keep wells under control at all times.  You must: Use the best 

available and safest drilling technology to monitor and evaluate well conditions and to minimize 

                                                 

107 See TREX  00003A  at  2  (interview  notes)  (“TO  [Transocean]  had  dismissed  drill  pipe  pressure  as  anything

the  potential  for  the  well  to  flow  or  kick.”).    Transocean’s  conduct  also  constituted  a  violation  of  

30 C.F.R. § 250.401(a); the other regulations do not apply to contractors.   

iv.

The  “Bladder  Effect” 

 
283.  As mentioned, the BP Well Site Leaders and the Transocean drill crew attributed 

the anomalous pressure on the drill pipe during  the  negative  pressure  test  to  a  “bladder  effect.”     

284.  Not   a   single   witness   had   ever   heard   of   the   “bladder   effect”   as   something   that  

would justify interpreting the negative pressure test as successful.  No party has contended that 

the  “bladder  effect”  provided  a  plausible  explanation  for  the  1,400 psi pressure on the drill pipe. 

285.  BP’s  Accident Investigation Report  stated  that  “the  investigation  team  could  find  

no evidence that such a phenomenon is possible, leaving the 1,400 psi unexplained unless it was 

caused  by  pressure  from  the  reservoir.”108 

286.  Five days after the blowout, Well Site Leader Bob Kaluza sent an e-mail to BP 

personnel that provided a detailed explanation as to how the “bladder  effect” could have created 

the  anomalous  pressure  reading.    Patrick   O’Byran,   BP’s   Vice   President   of   Drilling   and  

Completions for the Gulf of Mexico at the time (and who, coincidentally, was on the HORIZON 

when the explosions occurred), responded to this explanation by typing: 

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? . . .  

 
followed by roughly another 500 question marks.  During  trial  Mr.  O’Byran  explained,  “[A]s  I  

sit  here  today,  I  don’t  understand  what  Mr.  Kaluza  was  trying to define, and this [the question-

mark-only response]  is  what  we  have  in  front  of  us  today.”109     

287.  There is some evidence that the “bladder  effect”  theory may have originated with 

the Transocean drill crew.  At trial Lee Lambert, a BP Well Site Leader trainee who was on the

rig on April 20, 2010, testified that Jason Anderson, the Transocean toolpusher on duty at the 

time of the negative pressure test, first provided the explanation that would later be known as the 

“bladder   effect,”  although  it  may  not  yet  have  acquired  that  name.    Notes  taken  by  BP 

investigators during their interviews with Well Site Leaders Don Vidrine and Bob Kaluza also 

reflect that Mr. Anderson first  proposed  the  “bladder  effect”  theory.  

288.  Unfortunately,  Jason  Anderson  and  the  other  members  of  the  Transocean  drill 

crew  who  were  in  the  drill  shack  at  the  time  did  not  survive  the  explosion,  and  therefore  the 

Court does not have the benefit of their testimony.   

289.  Nevertheless, there are reasons to question whether the “bladder  effect”  originated  

with Jason Anderson, but the Court need not discuss them at length.  Even if the “bladder  effect”  

theory originated with a Transocean employee, the BP Well Site Leaders—the ones ultimately 

responsible for determining the outcome of the negative pressure test—accepted it as a viable 

explanation for the 1,400 psi pressure on the drill pipe.  Notably, Lee Lambert testified that after 

Mr.  Anderson  described  the  phenomenon,  Lambert  asked  Well  Site  Leader  Kaluza  if  the 

phenomenon  was  possible,  who  said  it  was.110    And  as  mentioned  above,  Mr.  Kaluza  gave  a 

detailed explanation after the incident of how the  “bladder  effect”  could have caused the pressure 

anomaly.  Kaluza’s  explanation  did  not  attribute  Jason  Anderson  as  the  source  of  the  “bladder  

effect  theory”  and  was  more  detailed  than  the  explanation  Anderson  allegedly  provided  to  Lee  

Lambert.      This  leads  the  Court  to  infer  that  the  theory  more  than  likely  originated  with  Mr. 

Kaluza. 

290.  The  BP  Well  Site  Leaders  should  have  had  the  experience  and  knowledge  to 

understand   the   “bladder   effect”  was  not  a  viable  explanation,  even  if  it  did  come  from  the

Transocean  drill  crew.    The  Court  agrees  with  the  opinion  of  Transocean’s   expert,   Calvin  

Barnhill, on this point: 

If  the  well  site  leaders’ versions  [regarding  the  origin  of  the  “bladder  effect”]  are 
correct this illustrates too much reliance on the drill crew in my opinion.  The drill 
crew, while having training in their respective jobs and having work experience 
on some of the most technically advanced wells ever drilled, were not formally 
trained engineers and did not have a complete knowledge of all facts.   The BP 
Well Site Leaders had multiple onshore BP technical personnel at their disposal to 
assist them in resolving the issue.  The BP personnel, both on the rig and onshore, 
were in a better position, with more data, to understand all the events and make 
the necessary decisions to safely TA [temporarily abandon] the Macondo Well.  If 
there [were] any questions[,] the BP well site leaders could have, should have and 
ultimately did get BP onshore involved.111 

291.  Neither  Transocean  nor  BP  should  have  relied  on  the  “bladder  effect”  to  justify  

 

the negative pressure test.  Even if the bladder effect originated with the Transocean drill crew, it 

does  not  lessen  BP’s  culpability.     

LCM Spacer 

 
v.
292.  The Court finds that the reason for the false reading from the kill line is because 

BP decided, unreasonably, to use left-over lost circulation  material  (“LCM”)  as  a  spacer  between  

the mud and seawater during the displacement and negative pressure test.112   

293.  LCM is normally used to plug fractured formations.  In fact, LCMs were used to 

strengthen the wellbore at Macondo following the lost returns incident on April 4, 2010.113  

294.  BP’s  expert,  Morten  Emilsen,  testified  that  the  LCM-spacer was a very viscous 

fluid, meaning it was thick and did not flow easily, similar to tar or molasses.   

295.  The  Court  finds  that  the  LCM-spacer  likely  clogged  the  kill  line  during  the 

negative pressure test, causing the zero pressure/no flow readings.

displacement.  

 

75 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 76 of 153

296.  Using LCM as a spacer was uncommon.  In fact, none of the drilling experts and 

practitioners who testified in this case had ever seen or heard of LCM being used in this manner.   

297.  Although M-I, the drilling fluids contractor, suggested using the left-over LCM as 

a spacer, it was ultimately BP who decided to do so.  Notably, M-I’s  Doyle  Maxie  pointed  out  to  

BP that there was a risk the LCM-spacer might plug small restrictions in the well.114   

298.  The Court further finds that BP decided to use the LCM as a spacer to avoid the 

cost of transporting and disposing of the LCM, as well as the cost of creating an entirely new 

spacer from scratch.  LCM had been stockpiled on the HORIZON in response to the lost return 

events that occurred while drilling the well.  Unused LCM typically must be transported to shore 

for disposal as a hazardous waste.  However, BP believed, rightly or wrongly, that if the LCM 

had  been  used  in  the  well,  they  simply  could  be  dumped  overboard  without  violating  any 

environmental  laws.    The  Court  agrees  with  the  opinion  of  Dr.  Beck  that  BP’s  decision  to  use  

LCM as a spacer was not driven by any operational motive, but rather to save time and money.115     

299.  BP’s   decision   to   use  the  LCM  as  a  spacer  was  unreasonable  and  led  to  the 

misinterpretation  of  the  negative  pressure  test.    This  is  another  reason  why  BP’s  culpability  with  

respect  to  the  negative  pressure  test  is  greater  than  Transocean’s.

Well Control Responsibilities 

health, safety, property, and the environment by . . . [p]erforming all operations in a safe and 

workmanlike manner.”116  Federal regulations also required that BP, as well as its contractors,:

and its contractors] must: 
 
(a) Use the best available and safest drilling technology to monitor and evaluate 
well conditions and to minimize the potential for the well to flow or kick;

301.  Under its contract with BP, Transocean had primary responsibility for monitoring 

   

the well at all times.  The Transocean employee specifically tasked with monitoring the well was 

the driller.   

302.  Transocean  was  also  responsible  for  activating  the  BOP  in  response  to  a  well 

control event and activating the diverter system to address any hydrocarbons that may enter the 

riser.    No  other  entity  on  the  DEEPWATER  HORIZON  was  responsible  for  the  BOP  or  the 

diverter system in terms of their activation in response to a well control event.     

303.  Under   Halliburton’s  contract  with  BP,  it  provided  mudloggers  who  acted  as  a 

“second  pair  of  eyes” on the well.  The mudlogger would monitor real time data relating to the

well’s  condition.    If  a mudlogger observed any anomalies, he or she was obligated to report them 

to  the  Transocean  drill  crew.    The  mudloggers  did  not  have  any  responsibility  or  ability  to 

activate the BOP. 

304.  The  Halliburton  mudloggers  monitored  well  data  from  a  building  on  the 

HORIZON  commonly  referred  to  as  the  “mud  shack.”    Halliburton used a program called InSite 

to   provide   well   data.      Halliburton’s   InSite  data  could  also  be  viewed  in  real  time  by  the 

Transocean drill crew, the BP Well Site Leaders, and BP engineers in Houston.         

305.  The  Transocean  drill  crew  performed  their  well  control  functions,  including 

monitoring the well, in the “drill  shack”  located  on  the  drill  floor.    The drill crew could monitor 

the   well   with   either   Halliburton’s   InSite   program,   or   Transocean’s   program   called   “HiTech.”  

Transocean’s   HiTech   data   could   also   be   viewed   by   the   BP   Well  Site  Leaders.    It  was  not 

available to the Halliburton mudloggers, nor was it sent to shore. 118 

306.  BP’s   Well   Site   Leaders   could   view   both   the   Transocean   and   Halliburton   data  

from their office and personal quarters.  As mentioned, the Halliburton data was also sent to and 

viewed by BP engineers onshore.   

8:00 p.m.: Final Displacement Commences 

 
ii.
307.  As mentioned above, some of the heavy drilling mud was displaced to seawater 

during the negative pressure test.  At the conclusion of the negative pressure test, the fluids in the 

drill  pipe/riser/BOP/well  were  generally  arranged  as  follows:    The  drill  pipe,  which  extended 

from the rig to a depth of 8,367 feet was filled with seawater.  The riser annulus (i.e., the space 

between the drill pipe and the riser, from the rig to the top of the BOP) was filled with mud and 

spacer; the mud was above the spacer.   From the BOP down to a depth of 8,367 feet (i.e., the 

                                                 

118  Because   Transocean’s   HiTech   data   was   not   transmitted   onshore,   it   was   lost   with   the   HORIZON.    

Consequently,  much  of  what  is  known  about  the  accident  comes  from  Halliburton’s  InSite  data.     

 

78 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 79 of 153

upper 3,367 feet of the well) was seawater.  The rest of the well below 8,367 was filled with 

mud.119   

308.  After BP Well Site Leader Vidrine declared the negative pressure test a success at 

7:55  p.m.,  he  instructed  the  Transocean  drill  crew  to  displace  the  remaining  mud  and  spacer 

above  8,367  feet  to  seawater,  per  BP’s  temporary  abandonment  procedure.  It was intended that 

the mud below 8,367 feet would remain in the well. 

309.  Figure 8 illustrates the planned displacement to seawater following the negative 

pressure test.  Fluid locations are not exact.

119 This description is not exact.   For example, while the mud and spacer are described as being above the BOP, 
some of the spacer was also inside the BOP.  Where two fluids met, mixing likely occurred to some extent.  This 
description also does not list all of the fluids that were in the well.  For example, freshwater was pumped between 
the spacer and seawater, but is not listed.  The hydrocarbons that would have entered the well during the negative 
pressure test also are not listed.

310.  Around 8:00 p.m., the drill crew opened the lower annular preventer, which had 

been closed for the negative pressure test to isolate the mud in the riser from the BOP and well.  

This increased the hydrostatic pressure in the well, temporarily returning it to an overbalanced 

state.  The Transocean drill crew then pumped seawater down the drill pipe, which pushed the 

spacer  and  mud  up  and  out  the  riser.    As  lighter  seawater  displaced  the  heavier  fluids,  the 

hydrostatic pressure in the well decreased.   

311.  At around 8:52 the well became underbalanced again, allowing hydrocarbons to 

begin  flowing  into  the  well  bore.    As  displacement  continued,  the  well  became  further 

underbalanced. 

9:01-9:08: First Anomaly 

 
iii.
312.  Between  9:01  and  9:08,  the  drill  pipe  pressure  increased  by  100  psi  while  the 

pumps ran at a constant rate.  Drill pipe pressure should have been decreasing at this time.  When 

viewed after the fact, this was the first indication (outside of the negative pressure test) that the 

well was in communication with the reservoir that could have been seen by someone on the rig.   

313.  There is no evidence that anyone noticed this increase when it occurred or, if they 

did, recognized it as a kick indicator.  

314.  The Court understands that it is easier to interpret well data after the fact.   For 

example,  an   investigator’s   analysis  of  data  from  9:08  p.m.  is  necessarily  informed  by  his 

knowledge  that  explosions  occurred  about  forty  minutes  later.    Obviously,  the  people  who 

viewed  this  data  in  real  time  as  it  was  recorded  on  April  20,  2010,  did not  have  this  benefit.  

Furthermore, the investigator deals with data that is static and has the luxury of time to analyze 

it.  Those on the rig would have dealt with data that scrolled steadily across a computer screen.   

Interpretations  had  to  be  made  quickly  in  order  to  permit  any  kind  of  meaningful  responsive 

action.  Thus, it is understandable that even a reasonable and prudent driller, for example, might 

 

80 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 81 of 153

overlook or dismiss a slight fluctuation of pressure, whereas an investigator after the fact might 

view the same data point as a tell-tale indicator of a kick.  

315.  The 100 psi increase in pressure over seven minutes between 9:01 and 9:08 would 

have appeared very subtle at the time.  Also, an increase in pressure is not necessarily indicative 

of  a  kick  (although  in  this  case  it  was).    Notably,  the  International  Association  of  Drilling 
Contractors states that a decrease in drill pipe pressure is a kick indicator, not an increase.   

316.  The  Court  finds  that  a  properly  trained,  reasonable,  and  prudent  person 

monitoring the well would not necessarily  have noticed the increase in pressure between 9:01 

and 9:08 as an indicator that the well was taking a kick.    

iv.

9:08-9:14: The Sheen Test and the Second Anomaly  

 
317.  As mud was displaced from the riser it was routed to one or more tanks or pits on 

the HORIZON.  Once all of the mud had been displaced from the riser, displacement paused for 

a sheen test.  The purpose of the sheen test was to determine if the spacer that followed the mud 

could be pumped overboard into the Gulf of Mexico without violating any environmental laws.   

318.  Between 9:08 and 9:14 the pumps were shut down for the sheen test.  During this 

time,  the  drill  pipe  pressure  increased  by  246  psi.    While  it  might  not  have  been  unusual  for 

pressure to remain once the pumps stopped, it should not have increased.  Data also indicates that 

it took longer than usual for fluid to stop flowing out of the well after the pumps were shut down.  

When viewed after the fact, these anomalies indicated hydrocarbons were flowing into the well.   

319.  There is no evidence that anyone noticed these anomalies when they occurred or, 

if they did, recognized them as indicating a kick.   

320. 

It  is  debatable  whether  the  anomalies  between  9:08  and  9:14  should  have  been 

noticed and investigated as potential kick indicators.  The pressure increase would have appeared 

subtle, but not as subtle as the earlier 100 psi increase.  Although flow continued after the pumps 

 

81 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 82 of 153

were shut down at 9:08, it soon began decreasing rapidly and had ceased entirely by 9:10.  There 

is some evidence that a flow check was conducted during the sheen test (i.e., while the pumps 

were off), but no flow was seen coming from the well.  This would have indicated that the well 

was  secure.    Notably,  well   control   experts   testified   that   a   flow   check   is   one   of   the   “gold  

standards”  for  determining  if  a  well  is  flowing.     On  the  other  hand,  Transocean’s  own drilling 

expert  concluded  in  his  report  that  the  pressure  anomaly  during  the  sheen  test  should  have 

prompted action from the drill crew and the mudlogger and  that  “displacement  should  not  have  

resumed  until  the  anomaly  was  diagnosed  and  the  appropriate  action  taken.”121 

321.  The Court finds that the anomalies between 9:08 p.m. and 9:14 p.m. should have 

been  noticed  by  the  Transocean  drill  crew  and  the  Halliburton  mudlogger,  and  that  these 

anomalies should have been investigated before the displacement continued.  Consequently, the 

Court also finds that Transocean and Halliburton violated 30 C.F.R. § 250.401. 

9:17: Pressure Spike  

 
v.
322.  Shortly before 9:14 p.m. Well Site Leader Vidrine determined the sheen test was 

successful and ordered that the pumps be restarted and return fluids sent overboard.  The pumps 

were restarted at 9:14 p.m. and displacement resumed.    

323.  Once  the  fluid  was  sent  through  the  overboard  pipe,  the  Halliburton  flow  out 

sensor  was  bypassed  and  the  Halliburton  mudlogger  could  no  longer  monitor  flow  out.  

Transocean’s  flow  out  sensor  was  not  bypassed, and therefore the Transocean drill crew could 

still monitor flow out.   

324.  Around 9:17 a large pressure spike registered on the kill line (the pressure rapidly 

increased and then dropped) as pump no. 2 was brought online.  The Transocean drill crew and 

the Halliburton mudlogger saw the pressure spike and reacted appropriately.  Pumps 2, 3, and 4

were immediately shut down (pump no. 1 remained on) and the Transocean driller dispatched 

personnel to the pump room to investigate.  

325.  Something  had  blocked  the  kill  line,  causing  pressure  to  spike  when  the  no.  2 

pump was started.122  A pressure relief valve subsequently opened, bringing the pressure back 

down.    

326.  These  events  were  not  indicative  of  a  kick.    However,  they  do  show  that  the 

Transocean drill crew and the Halliburton mudlogger were responsive to the well.   

vi.

9:31-9:38: The Transocean Drill Crew Fails to Timely Shut In the Well 

 
327.  Around 9:20 p.m. pumps 3 and 4 were restarted.  Pump no. 2 remained off.   

328.  Around 9:25 p.m. pressure slowly started to build on the kill line.   At 9:26 the 

pressure increased more rapidly and was around 830 psi by 9:27 p.m..  Thereafter the pressure 

gradually declined.  

329.  Between 9:27 and 9:30 p.m., the Transocean drill crew  recognized the pressure 

readings on the kill line as an anomaly (although not yet as indicating a kick) and decided to shut 

down the pumps to investigate.  Pumps 3 and 4 were shut down by 9:30 p.m.  Pump no. 1 was 

shut down by 9:31 p.m.    

330.  Around 9:31 p.m., with all pumps off, pressure started to build on the drill pipe. 

331.  Mr.  Barnhill  stated   that   “[o]nce   the   rig   pumps   were   shut   down   by   21:31   [9:31  

p.m.], a manual flow check followed by an immediate shut-in of the Macondo Well should have 

occurred.    This  is  basic  well  control  that  both  men  were  schooled  in  and  had  successfully 

engaged  in,  in  the  past.”123  In fact, all of the drilling experts in this case uniformly testified that 

                                                 

122 The LCM-spacer that had blocked the kill line during the negative pressure test was likely also the cause of 

this pressure spike.

83 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 84 of 153

when the pumps were shut down at 9:31 p.m., the Transocean drill crew should have performed 

a flow check and then immediately shut in the well.       

332.  Under Transocean’s policy and standard industry guidelines, the Transocean drill 

crew  must  shut  in  the  well  as  quickly  as  possible  if  a  kick  is  indicated  or  suspected.    As 

Transocean’s  expert  stated,  the  standard  is  to  “[s]hut  in  and  then figure out what  you’ve  got.”    

The Transocean driller had full authority to shut in the well; he did not need permission from the 

BP Well Site Leader.   

333.  The  Transocean  drill  crew  did  not  perform  a  flow  check  at  9:31,  nor  did  they 

attempt to shut in the well.  These actions would not occur until around 9:41 p.m.   

334.  The Court finds that the Transocean drill crew’s  conduct fell below the standard 

of care when, upon shutting down the pumps at 9:31 p.m., they failed to perform a flow check 

followed by immediately shutting in the well.  This also constituted a violation of 30 C.F.R § 

250.401. 

335.  Furthermore, the Court finds that hydrocarbons did not enter the riser (i.e., move 

above the BOP) until at least 9:38 p.m.  Once in the riser, there was nothing to stop hydrocarbons 

from reaching the surface.124  Therefore, had the Transocean drill crew acted appropriately, the 

well  would  have  been  shut  in  while  hydrocarbons  were  below  the  BOP,  at  which  point  they 

likely could have been circulated out of the well and the blowout and explosion avoided.   

336.  Consequently,  the  Court  finds  that  the  Transocean  drill  crew  failed  to  exercise 

proper well control, which was a cause of the blowout, explosion, and oil spill.   

                                                 

124 As explained below, the only means of stopping hydrocarbons in the riser from blowing out onto the rig is by 

activating the diverter system and sending the flow overboard.

vii.

 

Actions by the Transocean Drill Crew Between 9:31 and 9:49 p.m., when the First 
Explosion Occurred.  

337.  After the pumps were shut down at 9:31 p.m., the drill pipe pressure increased 

from 1,240 psi to 1,750 psi over the next three minutes.125  Meanwhile, pressure was steadily 

decreasing on the kill line, as it had been since about 9:27 p.m.  A witness heard the Transocean 

toolpusher  and  driller  discussing  “differential   pressure”   around   this   time,   but   noted   that   their  

demeanor was not overly concerning.  This indicates the drill crew viewed either or both of these 

pressures as an anomaly, but did not interpret them as indicating a kick.   

338.  The Transocean drill crew attempted to diagnose or troubleshoot the anomaly by 

bleeding  off  the  pressure  on  the  drill  pipe.    As  discussed  above,  the  drill  crew  should  have 

performed a flow check and then shut in the well before attempting to diagnose the issue.  Per 

the   Transocean   driller’s   instruction,   a  floorhand  opened  a  valve  on  the  standpipe  manifold 

around 9:36 p.m.  The pressure on the drill pipe dropped significantly but not entirely.  Pressure 

quickly built up to 1,400 psi upon closing the valve at 9:38. 

339.  After the stand pipe was closed the drill crew  began lining up the return fluids 

with the trip tank to perform a flow check.  

340.  At 9:40 or 9:41 p.m., the flow check was performed and significant flow from the 

well was noted.   

341.  Around this time mud began to spill onto the rig floor.126   

342.  At  9:41  or  9:42,   the   Transocean   drill   crew   activated   the   BOP’s   upper   annular  

preventer.127  The upper annular was closed by 9:42 or 9:43, but did not fully seal around the 

                                                 

125 The increase in drill pipe pressure at 9:31 p.m. reflects the fact that the top of the heavy drilling mud, which 

was previously below the drill pipe, was pushed above the bottom of the drill pipe by the hydrocarbon influx.    

126 At some point mud shot up the derrick.  This may have occurred as early as 9:41, at the same time mud 

began to spill on the rig floor.  By other accounts, mud did not shoot up the derrick until around 9:44 p.m.   

 

85 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 86 of 153

drill pipe.  This was because the annular preventer closed on the shoulder of a tool joint (where 

two segments of drill pipe meet), rather than on a pipe of uniform diameter. 

343.  Around the time the Transocean drill crew activated the annular preventer or soon 

thereafter, they closed the diverter packer and routed the flow of hydrocarbons to the mud-gas 

separator  (“MGS”).    As  discussed  below,  the  crew  should  have  diverted  flow  overboard  and 

away from the rig, rather than to the MGS.   

344.  The MGS was quickly overwhelmed.  Around 9:44 mud and water sprayed from 

the MGS vents.     

345.  At approximately 9:46 p.m. a loud hissing noise began.  High pressure gas had 

reached the rig surface and began venting onto the HORIZON’s  deck and into enclosed spaces.   

346.  At 9:46 p.m. the drill crew activated the BOP’s  upper and middle variable bore 

rams, which closed around the drill pipe by 9:47.128   

347.  At 9:47 p.m., the drill pipe pressure started rapidly increasing, indicating that the 

variable  bore  rams  had  sealed  the  annulus.    This  likely  led  the  drill  crew  to  believe  they  had 

regained control of the well.  However, gas continued to vent onto the rig.      

348.  At 9:49 the gas ignited and exploded.  The ignition source is unknown.   Given 

the extent to which the gas had likely spread by this point, multiple potential ignition sources 

existed.    

Diversion to the Mud-Gas Separator 

 
viii.
349.  Once hydrocarbons enter the riser, the only way to prevent them from blowing out 

onto the rig is by using the diverter system.   
                                                                                                                                                             
127 The upper annular preventer is one of the sealing elements in the BOP.  It is a doughnut-shaped element 
designed  to  close  around  the  drill  pipe  and  seal  the  annulus  between  the  drill  pipe  and  the  BOP  wellbore.    The 
annular preventer does not shear through or seal the drill pipe itself. 

128 The variable bore rams are two more sealing elements in the BOP.  Like the annular preventer, variable bore 
rams are designed to seal the annulus between the drill pipe and the BOP wellbore, but they do not shear or seal the 
drill pipe.   

 

86 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 87 of 153

350.  To operate the system, the Transocean  drill crew member  would first  close the 

diverter packers by pushing the appropriate button on the BOP control panel.  He would then 

push   a   button   marked   “OVERBOARD”   if   he   intended   to   divert   the  flow  overboard,  or 

“VERTICAL/MGS”   if   he   intended   to   send   return   fluids   to   the   MGS.    If  he  selected 

“OVERBOARD,”  he  would  then  press  “PORT,”  “STARBOARD,”  or  “BOTH,”  depending  on  

which way he wanted the fluids to discharge.     

351.  The MGS is a low-pressure system used to separate small amounts of gas from 

drilling mud; it was not designed or intended to handle the volumes and pressures that occurred 

on April 20, 2010.   

352.  The  purpose  of  the  overboard  diverter  was  to  divert  gas  away  from  the  rig.  

Transocean’s  well  control  procedures  instructed  that  “if  there  is  a  rapid  expansion  of  gas  in  the  

riser,  the  diverter  must  be  closed  (if  not  already)  and  the  flow  diverted  overboard.”129  

Furthermore,   Transocean’s   Major   Accident   Hazard   Risk   Assessment   of   the   DEEPWATER  

HORIZON  listed  “[u]tilization  of  diverter  system”  as  a  mitigation  for  “[g]as  in  riser.”130   

353.  As  mentioned  above,  fluids  were  initially  diverted  to  the  MGS,  not  overboard.  

The MGS was quickly overwhelmed.  Gas reached the rig at 9:46 p.m. and subsequently vented 

onto the rig from several release points due to diversion to the MGS.   

354.  Fluids should have been diverted overboard, rather than to the MGS.  

355. 

If  the  drill  crew  had  diverted  overboard,  it  would  have  at  least  delayed,  if  not 

avoided, the explosion.  As  BP’s drilling expert, Dr. Adam Bourgoyne, explained, even if the 

crew  had  diverted  overboard,  the  diverter  system  likely  would  have  failed  after  some  time.  

However, diverting overboard would have provided the crew with more time during which they

could  have  taken  further  actions,  such  as  shearing  through  the  drill  pipe  and,  if  necessary, 

disconnecting the HORIZON from the well.     

356.  The default setting on the diverter system was to direct flow to the MGS, which 

might explain why the flow was diverted to the MGS.  There is evidence that BP desired this 

default  in  order  to  avoid  discharging  oil-based  mud  into  the  Gulf.    It  also  appears  that 

Transocean agreed with this default setting, or at least did not object to it.131    

357.  Even if the default setting was to divert to the MGS, the diverter should have been 

lined  up  to  discharge  overboard  prior  to  displacing  the  well  to  seawater,  as  Dr.  Bourgoyne 

explained.   

358. 

If the drill crew intentionally diverted the flow to the MGS, then it evinces a lack 

of training in the proper use of the diverter system, given the situation they encountered.   As Dr. 

Bourgoyne stated in his report,  

The [Transocean] training material that I reviewed was appropriate and of a high 
quality.  What may have been lacking were adequate emergency drills simulating 
high flow rate conditions.  Training intensity for dangerous but very rare events is 
always  hard  to  maintain.    When  an  event  does  happen,  the  response  has  to  be 
automatic.  There might not be time to think about it.132   

 
Notably, an investigation report of a riser unloading incident on another Transocean MODU in 

2009 noted  a  “lack  of  explanation  about  the  proper  use  of  the  diverter.”133 

359.  Whether the reason flow was diverted to the MGS was because it was the default 

setting on the diverter system or because it was a conscious decision by the Transocean crew, the 

Court  agrees  with  Dr.  Bourgoyne’s  conclusion  that  the  diverter  system  should  have  been  set  up  

so that if the pressure in the MGS exceeded a certain point, flow would be automatically rerouted

to the overboard diverter lines.134  Dr. Bourgoyne explained that such technology was available 

prior to 1999, and it would have been feasible, practical, and not cost prohibitive to use.    

360.  Finally, some witnesses claim they saw a defined stream of fire flowing from the 

overboard diverter line.  Based on these accounts, Transocean argues the drill crew eventually 

diverted  overboard.    BP’s  investigation  report  concluded  that  this  stream  was  likely  from  a  relief  

line on the MGS, which was near the overboard line.   It is  also  possible that  elements  in the 

diverter system eventually failed during the blowout, allowing hydrocarbons to take a number of 

flow paths, including but not limited to the overboard lines.  The Court finds that the weight of 

the evidence shows that the Transocean drill crew likely did not divert flow overboard.   

Simultaneous Operations Hindered Well Monitoring 

 
ix.
361.  Transocean  bears  much  of  the  blame  for  the  well  monitoring  and  well  control 

failures.  Halliburton shares some of the blame for missing the anomaly between 9:08 and 9:14 

p.m.  However, the Court finds that BP also shares a substantial part of the blame for the well 

monitoring and well control failures.   

362.  BP was responsible for ensuring that procedures on the rig allowed for the proper 

monitoring  of  the  well,   and   BP’s   Well   Site   Leaders   decided   whether   simultaneous   operations  

would be permitted during displacement.   

363.  Normally,  operations  which  could  affect  well  monitoring  are  halted  during 

sensitive operations such as well displacement.  BP allowed simultaneous operations during the 

safety-critical operation of displacement.   

364.  One of the most significant parameters for kick detection is total pit volume.  BP 

did not insist on a closed-pit system during the displacement; instead, BP permitted the rig crew

to pump seawater from the sea chest directly to the well, meaning no one could monitor the total 

balance of pit volumes.     

365.  Another  significant  parameter  for  kick  detection  is  the  ability  to  compare  flow 

into  the  well  vs.  flow  out  of  the  well.    During  the  final  displacement,  pit  transfers  and  other 

activities occurred that sometimes increased flow across the flow line.  This masked flow out of 

the well.   

366.  As noted above, after fluids were dumped overboard following the sheen test, the 

Halliburton flow meter was entirely bypassed.   

367.  There  is  some  evidence  that  crane  operations  during  displacement  and  the 

resulting rig heave may have caused flow line and pit volume fluctuations as well.   

368.  By allowing these operations, BP impeded the ability of the Transocean drill crew 

and the Halliburton mudlogger to monitor for a kick.  The Court finds that BP violated 30 C.F.R. 

§ 250.401(a),(c),(d).  

369.  On  a  related  note,  the  BP  Well  Site  Leader  should  have  prepared  a  pump 

displacement  schedule  for  the  drill  crew.    A  pump  displacement  schedule  identifies  what 

pressures should occur at different steps of the displacement.  This enhances the ability to detect 

pressure anomalies.  Given that primary kick indicators such as pit volume and flow out were 

compromised during the displacement, BP should have prepared a pump displacement schedule.

The BOP’s  Automatic  Functions:  AMF  and  Autoshear 
 
370.  The BOP is a safety-critical device.  Generally speaking, a BOP sits on top of the 

i.

Configuration of the HORIZON’s  BOP 

wellhead and acts as a barrier that can be activated, either manually or automatically, to close in 

a well and prevent hydrocarbons from flowing up into the riser.    

 

90 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 91 of 153

371.  BOPs can be configured in different ways.  For example, the number and type of 

sealing and shearing elements may vary from BOP to BOP.  The  DEEPWATER  HORIZON’s  

BOP stack was manufactured and supplied by Cameron.  However, BP and Transocean specified 

the  configuration  of  the  HORIZON’s   BOP  stack,  including  the  number  and  type  of  ram 

preventers, bore size, and working pressures.   

372.  Figure 9 is  an  illustration  of  the  HORIZON’s BOP stack: 

Figure 9 135

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 92 of 153

373.  The  HORIZON’s  BOP  stack  was  comprised  of  two  main  parts:  a  lower  marine  

riser  package  (“LMRP”)  and  a  lower  BOP  stack.    The  LMRP  sat atop the lower BOP stack.   

374.  The  LMRP  contained  two  sealing  elements:  an  upper  annular  preventer  and  a 

lower annular preventer.  These are doughnut-shaped elements designed to close around the drill 

pipe and seal the annulus.136  They do not cut through or seal the drill pipe.     

375.  The  lower  BOP  stack  contained  five  pairs  of  rams.      Those  were,  from  top  to 

bottom,  the   blind   shear   rams   (“BSRs”),   casing   shear   rams,   upper   variable   bore   rams,   middle  

variable bore ram, and test rams. 

376.  The BSRs consist of two rams on opposite sides of the wellbore.  Each ram has a 

blade.  On this specific model BSR, known as a Shearing Blind Ram, one of the blades had a 

shallow  “V”  shape  to  it  when  viewed  from  above.    The  other  blade  was  straight.   Neither blade 

extended  across  the  entire  BOP  wellbore.    When  activated,  the  rams  are  designed  to  close 

together, shearing the drill pipe between them and sealing the well.  Notably, the BSRs were the 

only  components  in  the  HORIZON’s  BOP  stack  designed  to  both  cut  drill  pipe  and  seal  the  well.       

                                                 

136  At the time of explosions, a 5-1/2  inch  drill  pipe  passed  through  the  BOP’s  wellbore.    Here,  “annulus”  refers  

to the space between the drill pipe and the BOP wellbore.     
92 

 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 93 of 153

377.  Figure 10 illustrates the BSRs used in  the  HORIZON’s  BOP and how they were 

intended to shear drill pipe.   

Figure 10 137 

 

378.  The casing shear rams were located beneath the BSRs.  The casing shear rams had 

two V-shaped blades.  The “V”  of  these  blades  was  much  deeper  than  the  “V”  of  the  one  BSR  

blade, and the casing shear rams had a greater shearing capacity than the BSRs.  However, unlike 

the BSRs, the casing shear rams do not seal the well upon closure.  

379.  Below  the  casing  shear  rams  were  the  upper  variable  bore  rams  and  then  the 

middle variable bore rams.  These rams were similar to the annular preventers in that they will 

seal the annulus between the drill pipe and wellbore, but they will not shear or seal the drill pipe.   

380.  At the bottom of the lower BOP stack were the test rams.  These could seal the 

annulus, but only with respect to flow coming from above.  The test rams would not stop flow 

coming from below; i.e., flow from the well.138   

                                                 

137 TREX 61123 at 9 (Stevick Expert Report) (crediting Det Norske Veritas report).  Note that the drill pipe is 
shown centered in the wellbore.  As discussed below, the drill pipe was actually against the side of the wellbore 
when the BSRs activated. 

138  The  HORIZON’s  lower  BOP  stack  was  originally  configured  with  a  third  pair  of  variable  bore  rams,  rather  

than the test rams.  In 2004, BP chose to convert the lower variable bore rams to test rams.

AMF and Autoshear 

 
ii.
381.  The BOP could be operated manually from the DEEPWATER HORIZON.   As 

previously  discussed,  some  of  the  BOP’s  sealing  elements  were  manually  activated  by  the  drill  

crew prior to the explosions.  There were also two methods by which the BOP was designed to 

function automatically. 

382.  Automatic   Mode   Function   (“AMF,”   also   called   the   “deadman”   function)   was  

intended to automatically close the BSRs upon certain emergency conditions.  These conditions 

were  a  loss  of  power,  communication,  and  hydraulic  supply  between  the  rig  and  the  BOP.   

When this occurred, the control pods located on the BOP stack, now running on battery power, 

would activate the BSRs.   

383.  The parties agree that the conditions for AMF were met during or shortly after the 

explosions at 9:49 p.m. on April 20, 2010. 139  As explained below, however, the parties disagree 

over whether the BSRs actually activated at this time.   

384.  The   second   method   is   “Autoshear,”   which   was   designed   to   automatically   close  

the BSRs if the LMRP detached from the lower BOP stack.   This could occur, for example, if 

the  HORIZON  drifted  too  far  off  station.    Unlike  AMF,  which  relies  on  electric  batteries  to 

function, Autoshear was a purely hydraulic operation.   

385.  On  April  22,  2010,  at  7:48  a.m.,  a  remotely  operated  vehicle  (“ROV”)  simulated  

LMRP detachment by cutting the Autoshear plunger on the outside of the BOP.  This did not 

detach the LMRP, but it should have activated the Autoshear system and closed the BSRs, unless 

they had already closed when AMF conditions were met two days earlier.   

                                                 

139 The MUX (multiplex electronic control) cables, which provided power and communication to the BOP, were 
likely  destroyed  in  the  initial  explosions.    The  hydraulic  line  may  have  lasted  slightly  longer  before  it  was 
compromised by the fire.   In any event, AMF conditions were present within a few minutes of the explosions.

iii.
386. 

Improper Maintenance Prevented AMF from Closing the BSRs on April 20, 2010. 

It  is  undisputed  that  the  BSRs  activated  at  some  point  after  the  explosions  on 

April 20 at 9:49 p.m., but before the HORIZON sank on April 22 a little after 10:00 a.m.     

387. 

It is also undisputed that the BSRs failed to seal the well.  

388.  The experts who testified about the BSRs agree that the reason the BSRs failed to 

seal the well is that the drill pipe was located on the side of the wellbore and partially outside the 

BSRs’  blades at the time the BSRs were activated.  This prevented the BSRs from fully closing 

and sealing the well.  

389.  The experts disagree over  exactly  when the BSRs activated.  There is  a related 

disagreement over what caused the drill pipe to be off-center.   

390.  Two theories were presented at trial as to when the BSRs activated.   

391.  Transocean’s  BOP expert, Greg Childs, opined that the BSRs closed when AMF 

conditions  were  met  on  April  20,  2010.    However,  the  rest  of  the  experts  concluded  that 

maintenance issues with the BOP prevented BSRs from activating at this time.  These experts 

instead believe that the BSRs did not close until the morning of April 22, 2010, when the ROV 

triggered the Autoshear function by cutting the Autoshear pin.   

392.  Having considered the testimony and evidence presented at trial, the Court agrees 

with the view that the BSRs did not activate when AMF conditions were met on April 20, 2010, 

due to improper maintenance on the BOP.   

393.  The  BOP  had  two  control  pods,  known  as  the  “blue  pod”  and  the  “yellow  pod.”    

In normal operations, these control pods would operate the BOP according to signals received 

from  the  rig  floor  through  MUX  cables.    When  the  control  pods  lost  electrical  and  hydraulic 

power and communication with the rig, the AMF systems within the pods would activate.  The 

 

95 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 96 of 153

control  pods  were  redundant;  either  one  or  both  could  activate  the  BSRs  whenever  AMF 

conditions were met.   

394.  Each control pod contained, among other things, a 27-volt battery and a solenoid 

valve.  In simplified terms, when AMF conditions are present electric current from the battery 

flows through the solenoid valve, causing it to open.  This releases pressurized hydraulic fluid 

that forces the BSRs closed.   

395.  The blue pod failed to activate the BSRs on April 20 because its 27-volt battery 

was too weak to open the solenoid valve.    

396.  Notably,  the  blue  pod’s  27-volt battery was in a depleted state when it was tested 

after  the  incident.    Other  batteries  in  the  blue  and  yellow  pods  were  found  to  be  sufficiently 

charged when tested after the incident.  As  BP’s  expert,  Arthur  Zatarain,  explained, the only way 

these  conditions  could  exist  is  if  the  blue  pod’s  27-volt battery was also in a depleted state on 

April   20,   2010.      Furthermore,   the   blue   pod’s   27-volt  battery  had  not  been  changed  since 

November of 2007, two-and-a-half years before the blowout.  Cameron, the manufacturer of the 

BOP, recommended that the 27-volt batteries be changed after one  year  of  “on-time  operation.”     

397.  The  yellow  pod  failed  to  activate  the  BSRs  at  AMF  time  because  its  solenoid 

valve—or more specifically, one of the coils within the solenoid valve—was reverse wired.    

398.  Within  each  solenoid  valve  are  two  coils  wrapped  around  a  metal  rod  called  a 

plunger.    A   spring   usually   holds   the   plunger   in   the   “closed”   position.      When  electric  current 

passes through these coils, a magnetic field is created.  In a properly functioning solenoid, this 

magnetic  field  moves  the  plunger  to  the  “open”  position,  creating a flow path for hydraulic fluid 

that ultimately activates the BSRs.   

 

96 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 97 of 153

399. 

It is undisputed that one of the two coils  in  the  yellow  pod’s  solenoid  valve  was  

reverse  wired.    Consequently,  the  reverse-wired  coil  produced  a  magnetic  field  with  polarity 

opposite  from  the  other  coil.    When  AMF  conditions  were  met  on  April  20,  2010,  each  coil 

simultaneously pulled in opposite directions, effectively cancelling out the other, and the plunger 

remained closed. 

400.  Debris   may   have   also   contributed   to   the   solenoid’s   failure.      The   Court   finds,  

however,  that  had  the  yellow  pod  solenoid  been  correctly  wired,  any  debris  would  not  have 

prevented the solenoid from opening.    

401.  Mr.  Childs,  Transocean’s  expert,  opined  that  the  27  volt  battery  in  the  blue  pod  

was  sufficiently  charged  on  April  20,  2010,  and  that  the  solenoid  in  the  yellow  pod  operated 

despite  being  reverse  wired.    The  Court  finds  these  explanations  lack  credibility  and  are 

unpersuasive. 

iv.

The BSRs Would Have Sealed the Well if AMF Had Functioned 

 
402.  There  were  conflicting  opinions  as  to  whether  the  BSRs  could  have  sealed  the 

well if they had activated when AMF conditions were met on April 20, 2010.   

403.  Some experts propose that by the time AMF conditions were met, the drill pipe 

was buckled and forcibly held off-center by the flow coming from the well.   

404.  Other experts proposed that the flow rate was not great enough to cause buckling 

at  this  time,  and  that  the  drill  pipe  should  have  been  centered  or  nearly  centered  when  AMF 

conditions were met.  These experts opined that the drill pipe was not forced to the side of the 

wellbore until sometime later. 

405.  Although there is much conflicting testimony on this issue, after weighing all of 

the evidence, the Court finds that it is more likely than not that the drill pipe would have been 

 

97 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 98 of 153

centered at the time AMF conditions were met on April 20, 2010 and, therefore, the BSRs would 

have fully sheared the drill pipe and sealed the well had they been activated by AMF.   

Responsibility for BOP Maintenance  

 
v.
406.  Under  then-existing  MMS  regulations,  BP  and  Transocean  were  required  to 

“maintain  [the] BOP system to ensure that the  equipment  functions  properly.”140   

407.  Under the contract between BP and Transocean, Transocean was responsible for 

maintaining  the  HORIZON’s  BOP.     

408.  Transocean had a policy of changing control pod batteries every year.  Cameron, 

the manufacturer of the BOP, similarly recommended that control pod batteries be replaced after 

“one  year  of  on-time  use.”     

409.  Despite   its   own   policy   and   Cameron’s   recommendation,   Transocean   had   not  

replaced  the  blue  pod’s  27-volt battery since November 2007.   

410.  A simple voltage test performed  on  the  blue  pod’s  batteries  before  deploying  the  

BOP  at  Macondo  would  have  detected  the  depleted  battery.    There  is  no  evidence  that 

Transocean conducted such a test.   

411.  Transocean also could have detected the depleted battery if it had run an actual 

AMF sequence  while the BOP was on the surface.  Although this sequence is  required under 

Transocean’s  Well  Control  Handbook,  there  is  no  evidence  that  it  was  done  before  deploying  the  

BOP   at   Macondo.      According   to   Transocean’s   Senior   Subsea   Supervisor,   AMF  had  not  been 

tested in eight years.   

412.  On   February   12,   2010,   Cameron   notified   Transocean’s   Subsea   Superintendent  

that  the  batteries  on  the  HORIZON’s  spare  control  pod  were  depleted  less  than  a  year  after  they  

                                                 

140 30  C.F.R.  §  250.400  (“The requirements of this subpart apply to lessees, operating rights owners, operators, 
and their contractors and subcontractors.”);;  30  C.F.R.  §  446  (“You  must  maintain  your  BOP  system  to  ensure  that  
the  equipment  functions  properly.  .  .  .”).     

 

98 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 99 of 153

had been installed on the spare control pod.  This alerted Transocean to other potential battery 

issues.    On  February  16,  2010,  Transocean’s  Subsea  Superintendent  forwarded  an  e-mail to the 

HORIZON’s   Subsea   Supervisors.      The   e-mail’s   subject   line   was   “Battery   replacement”   and  

contained a bulletin from Cameron  that  stated  the  control  pod’s  batteries  should  be  changed  after  

“[o]ne  year  of  on  time  operation.”    Three  days  later,  Transocean’s  Subsea  Supervisor  aboard  the  

HORIZON  attempted  to  check  the  battery  charge  of  the  blue  pod,  but  could  not  obtain  that 

information while the blue pod was latched onto the Macondo well.   On February 24, 2010, the 

HORIZON’s   Senior   Subsea   Supervisor   informed   Transocean’s   Rig   Manager-Asset  for  the 

HORIZON  that  the  blue  pod’s  batteries  had  not  been  changed  since  November  of  2007.   Despite 

discovering that the batteries in the blue pod had not been changed since 2007, and after a futile 

attempt to ascertain the charge of the blue pod batteries while on the Macondo well, and with 

knowledge that the batteries in the spare pod were depleted after less than a  year, there is  no 

evidence  that  Transocean  took  any  further  action  to  determine  the  charge  of  the  blue  pod 

batteries.   

413.  Additionally,  there  was  alternative  technology  available  with  rechargeable 

batteries and battery monitoring  that  could  have  been  incorporated  into  the  HORIZON’s  BOP.    

This  technology  was  being  utilized  on  many  drilling  rigs.    Of  the  29  control  systems  in 

Cameron’s  2008  build  cycle,  23  of  those  used  this  technology  (known  as  the  Mark  III  control  

system).  BP even  upgraded  to  this  system  on  another  rig.    Had  the  HORIZON’s  control  system  

been  similarly  upgraded,  the  depleted  battery  would  have  been  detected  and  presumably 

changed.   

414.  The solenoid valve at issue in the yellow pod was rebuilt and installed in February 

2010.      The  wiring  defect  could  have  been  detected  simply  by  following  the  solenoid  testing 

 

99 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 100 of 153

protocol that Cameron and Transocean provided.  There is no evidence that the proper testing 

was performed on the solenoid valve.  

415.  Accordingly,  Transocean  is  responsible  for  failing  to  maintain  the  BOP  and 

consequently violated 30 C.F.R. § 250.446.  This fault may also be attributable to BP by virtue of 

30 C.F.R § 250.400, but the Court does not reach this issue.   

vi.

 

The  BSRs  Partially  Closed,  but  Did  Not  Seal,  on  April  22,  2010,  When  the 
Autoshear Plunger Was Cut 

416.  The  Court  finds  that  the  BSRs  first  activated  on  April  22,  2010,  at  7:48  a.m., 

when an ROV simulated LMRP detachment by cutting the Autoshear pin on the BOP.     

417.  Even though the BSRs activated at Autoshear time, they could not fully close and 

seal the well because the drill pipe was against the side of the wellbore and partially outside the 

BSRs’  blades.         

418.  As   previously   noted,   the   BSRs’   blades   did   not   span   the  entire  width  of  the 

wellbore.  The  BOP’s  wellbore  was  18-3/4 inches.  The BSRs’  lower blade was 17-7/8 inches; 

the upper, V-shaped, blade was 15-1/4 inches.      

419.  The  Court  heard  various  theories  as  to  why  the  drill  pipe  was  off-center.    As 

mentioned  earlier,  some  experts  believe  the  upward  flow  from  the  well  buckled  the  pipe.141  

Some experts opined that the drill pipe was buckled by a sudden force from above—when the 

heavy traveling block in  the  HORIZON’s  derrick  fell,  which  occurred  approximately  30  minutes 

                                                 

141  Transocean’s   expert,   Greg   Childs,   testified   that   the   drill   pipe   would   have   been   buckled   by   a   force   from  
below at  the time  AMF conditions  were  met, but that the  pipe  would not be buckled  later,  when  Autoshear  was 
activated.    Halliburton’s  expert,  Dr.  Glen  Stevick,  testified  that  the  drill  pipe  would  have  been  buckled  by  upward  
flow  when  AMF conditions  were  met, and it  would have remained buckled  when  Autoshear  was activated.  The 
United States expert, Dr. Rory Davis, testified that upward forces were not great enough to push the pipe off-center 
at the time AMF conditions were met; however, he further testified that by the time Autoshear was activated, the 
conditions had changed such that there were a number plausible reasons for the drill pipe to be off-center, including 
upward flow from the well.

after the explosions on April 20, 2010.142  A third theory was that the HORIZON had drifted far 

enough from the well that drill pipe deflected inside the BOP, causing it to be off-center.143     

420.  The Court finds it is not necessary to determine why the drill pipe was off-center 

at the time Autoshear activated.  It is clear that the pipe was off center at this time, and for that 

reason, the BSRs could not fully shear through the pipe and seal the well.   

vii.

The Configuration of the BOP Was Not Unreasonable or Not Causal 

 
421.  The specific model BSRs used  on  the  HORIZON’s  BOP  was  Cameron’s  Shearing  

Blind  Rams.    As  noted  above,  this  model  had  one  V-shaped  blade  and  a  straight  blade.144  

Neither blade spanned the entire width of the well bore.   

422.  Some  parties  contend  that  BP  and   Transocean   should   have   selected   Cameron’s  

DVS   (Double   “V”   Shear)   rams   instead   of   the  single-V  Shearing  Blind  Ram.    The  DVS  rams 

have  two  V-shaped  blades,  which,  according  to  the   United   States’   expert,  Dr.  Rory  Davis, 

increased its ability to center drill pipe in the well bore.  These parties note that DVS rams were 

available when the HORIZON was built, or they easily could have been retrofitted later.   

423.  However, it has not been shown that the DVS rams would have succeeded where 

the single-V Shearing Blind Rams failed.  Notably, the blades on the DVS also do not span the 

entire wellbore.   

424.  Accordingly, the Court finds that the decision to use the Shearing Blind Rams as 

opposed to the DVS rams did not prevent the BOP from sealing the well.  

425.  Several  other  arguments  were  raised  that   the   HORIZON’s   BOP  and  related 

components should have been configured differently.  The Court finds that some of these issues 

                                                 

142    BP’s   expert,   Forrest   Shanks,   II,   testified   in   support   of   this   theory.      Dr.   Davis   also   found   this   theory  

plausible. 

143  Dr. Davis proposed this theory.   
144 See supra Figure 10

were not causal.  As to other issues, it has not been shown that the selected configuration was 

below industry standard, below regulatory standards, or otherwise unreasonable.145     
K. 

Actions by the Marine Crew 
 
426.  The  Emergency  Disconnect  Sequence  (“EDS”) is a function that closes the BSRs 

EDS and the Master’s  Overriding Authority  

i.

and  detaches  the  LMRP  from  the  lower  BOP  stack,  allowing  the  HORIZON  to  drift  or  drive 

away from the well.146 

427.  EDS could be activated from the drill shack, engine control room, or the bridge.  

Activating EDS required pushing at most two buttons on the BOP control panel. 

428.  EDS was not attempted until a few minutes after the explosions occurred at 9:49 

p.m.  By the time EDS was attempted, the MUX cables and hydraulic lines that ran from the rig 

to the BOP had been destroyed.  Consequently, no elements in the BOP operated and the LMRP 

did not detach when EDS was first attempted on April 20, 2010.   

429.  The Court heard competing opinions over when EDS should have been attempted.   

430.  BP’s   expert,   Captain   Andrew   Mitchell,   and   the   PSC’s   expert,   Geoff   Webster,  

concluded that a prudent master should have activated EDS upon seeing mud rain down on the 

M/V DAMON BANKSTON (“BANKSTON”), which they contend occurred around 9:41 p.m.  

Under this timeline, the master would have had about 8 minutes to activate EDS before the first 

explosion occurred.   

                                                 

145  The  Court  notes  that  the  events  of  April  20,  2010  may  very  well  change,  if  they  have  not  already,  the 
standard by  which BOPs  will be judged.  Consequently, configurations or components  that  were once viewed as 
reasonable or meeting regulatory standards, etc., may no longer suffice.  Here, however, the Court does not apply a 
post-Macondo standard, whatever it may be.   

146 There  were  actually  two  EDS  modes  on  the  HORIZON.      The  mode  described  is  commonly  called  “EDS- 1”  
or  “EDS-Normal.”    Under  “EDS-2”  or  “EDS-Casing,”  the  CSRs  activate  first,  then  the  BSRs,  and  then  the  LMRP  
detaches. 

 

102 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 103 of 153

431.  According to Transocean’s  expert,  Jeff Wolfe, the first evidence of a well control 

event that could be observed by the master was when gas alarms began to sound on the bridge, 

which occurred only 2 or 3 minutes before the explosion.  Mr. Wolfe further explained that EDS 

is  a  last  resort  when  all  well  control  efforts  have  failed  and  that  initiating  EDS  without 

confirming  the  status  of  the  drill  crew’s  well  control  efforts  could  have  interfered  with  activities  

that the drill crew was taking to shut in the well.  Also, if a tool joint is across the BSRs when 

EDS  is  activated,  they  might  not  fully  shear  the  pipe  and  seal  the  well,  meaning  that 

hydrocarbons  would  discharge  into  the  sea  once  the  LMRP  detached.    Mr.  Wolfe  pointed  to 

evidence that the bridge crew was trying to establish communication with the drill floor when the 

blowout  occurred.    Based  on  this  and  the  short  amount  of  time  the  master  had  to  act,  he 

concluded that the failure to activate EDS before the explosions was not improper.     

432.  The  explosions  were  preceded  by  a  series  of  events  that  would  have  been 

observed  by  the  HORIZON’s   master,  Captain  Curt  Kuchta,  while  he  was  on  the  bridge.  

However,  there  is  conflicting  evidence  as  to  when  these  events  occurred  and/or  what  was 

observed from the bridge, making it difficult to establish an exact timeline of events.  Having 

considered  the  evidence  and  the  testimony,  the  Court  finds  that  the  master  witnessed  the 

following events prior to the explosions:   

433.  Sometime between 9:41 p.m. and 9:46 p.m., the HORIZON jolted and/or began to 

shake.   

434.  Seconds  after  the  jolt  and/or  shaking  started  but  before  9:46  p.m.,  the  master 

opened  a  door  on  the  port  side  of  the  bridge  and  saw  drilling  mud  raining  down  on  the 

BANKSTON. 

 

103 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 104 of 153

435.  After the jolt and/or shaking started but before 9:46 p.m., someone from the drill 

floor called the bridge and said, “we  have  a  well  control  issue”  or  something  similar,  and  hung  

up.  The Dynamic  Positioning  Operator  (“DPO”)  who  answered  the   call  attempted  to  call  the  

drill floor back, but no one responded.  

436.  Around 9:46 p.m., there was a loud hissing noise.       

437.  Seconds after the hissing noise,  gas alarms began to go off on the bridge.  The 

first alarm indicated gas was in the shale shaker room.  This alarm was immediately followed by 

many  other  gas  alarms.    The  Senior  DPO  called  the  shale  shaker  room  to  warn  anyone  there 

about the gas, but no one answered after seven rings. 

438.  Around 9:47 or 9:48 p.m., the bridge received a second call  that  said  “well  control  

situation”  and  hung  up.    The  junior  DPO  called  the  drill  floor,  but  no  one  answered.     

439.  Sometime before 9:48 p.m., the junior DPO, the senior DPO, and/or the master 

radioed the BANKSTON and told it to move away from the HORIZON.147   

440.  When  the  master  felt  the  rig  shake  and  then  saw  mud  raining  down  on  the 

BANKSTON, he should have understood that a blowout was occurring.  When he heard the loud 

hissing noise, he should have suspected, if not believed, that combustible gas from the well was 

venting onto the HORIZON.  The first gas alarm should have confirmed this suspicion or belief.  

When the other gas alarms sounded, the master should have understood that a large amount of 

gas was rapidly spreading over the HORIZON, and that the HORIZON and her crew were in 

imminent danger.  The master should have activated EDS at this point.   

441.  When the shale shaker and the drill floor did not answer the calls from the bridge, 

the master should have assumed that EDS provided the only chance of avoiding catastrophe.148  

                                                 

9:42 p.m.  Other accounts state 9:48 p.m.   

147 It is unclear when this occurred.  By some accounts, the BANKSTON was told to move away as early as 

 

104 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 105 of 153

Accordingly, the Court finds  that a prudent and  properly trained master  would have  activated 

EDS between 9:47 and 9:48, if not when the gas alarms sounded.     

442.  Furthermore,  the  Court  finds  that  the  master’s  failure  to  timely  activate  EDS  was  

not because he was attempting to communicate with the drill floor, as Transocean suggests.  The 

Court instead finds that the master did not timely activate EDS because he did not believe that he 

had the authority to do so.   

443.  Under Transocean’s policy, the Offshore  Installation  Manager  (“OIM”)  was  the  

“person   in   charge”   while   the   HORIZON   was   in   drilling   mode   or   on   location.      When  the 

HORIZON  was  in  transit  mode,  the  master  was  the  “person in  charge.”    Under the International 

Safety Management Code and other laws applicable to the HORIZON, the master should have 

retained overriding authority at all times and should take command during an emergency.   

444.  There are some inconsistencies among Transocean’s  policy  documents  regarding  

the HORIZON’s  command  structure.    On  whole,  however,  they  generally  reflect  that  the  master  

would  take  command  in  an  emergency.    However,  Transocean’s  policy  was  not  clear  on  what  

constituted  an  “emergency”  or  how  the  transition occurred.  A poignant example comes from a 

letter  sent  to  the  HORIZON’s   master   on   August   22,   2009,  that  stated,  in   pertinent   part,   “the  
Company designates the Master ‘Person  in  Charge’  during  and  [sic] emergency as specified in 

the  Station  Bill.”  The  letter  goes  on  to  state,  “Well  Control  Operations  are  not  an  ‘emergency’  

within the scope of this paragraph.”149   

                                                                                                                                                             
148 The Court previously noted that the drill crew may have believed they regained well control at 9:47, once the 
variable  bore  rams  had  closed.    However,  no  one  on  the  bridge  would  have  known  what  the  drill  crew  likely 
believed.

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 106 of 153

445.  Even  Transocean’s  expert  conceded  that  “when  they  started  seeing  .  .  .  the  mud  

and/or   gas   alarm”   an   emergency   was   present   such  that  the  master  became  the   “person   in  

charge.”150   

446.  The weight of the evidence showed that Captain Kuchta did not believe he was in 

charge  when  those  events  occurred  or  even  after  the  explosions.    Instead,  Captain  Kuchta 

believed the OIM, Jimmy Harrell, was still in charge.   Notably, the master wanted permission 
from the OIM to activate EDS even after the explosions occurred and the rig was on fire.151   

447.  The Court finds that Transocean’s  ambiguous   command  structure  regarding  the  

master’s  authority  in  emergency  situations caused him to fail to activate EDS in a timely manner.  

Captain  Kuchta  was  inadequately  trained  in  the  use  of  EDS.    Captain  Kuchta  also  had  not 

received  Major  Emergency  Management  training,  nor  had  he  been  assessed  competent  as  a 

person  in  charge,  both  of  which  Transocean  required  for  its  masters.    These  deficits  are 

significant,  given  that  one  of  the  reasons  EDS  could  be  activated  from  the  bridge  was  “so  that  the  

master can exercise his overriding authority and responsibility to take whatever action he needs 

to  take  to  save  his  ship,  safeguard  his  crew,  [and]  protect  the  environment  .  .  .  .”152   

448.  The  Court  finds  that  if  EDS  had  been  activated  when  the  drill  crew  failed  to 

respond   to   the   DPO’s   call,   the   BSRs   would   have   shut   in   the   well,   the   LMRP   would   have 

detached, and the rig would have drifted away from the well.    

449.  However, activating EDS at this time would not have avoided the explosions.  At 

that point gas would have already been in the riser, and it would have continued upwards and 

vented  onto  the  rig  floor  even  though  the  LMRP  had  detached.    Nevertheless,  without  a

151  Jimmy  Harrell  did  not  arrive  on  the  bridge  until  a  few  minutes  after  the  explosions.      When  he  did,  he 

immediately instructed someone to activate EDS.

continuous  flow  of  hydrocarbons  to  fuel  the  fire,  the  consequences  probably  would  not  have 

been as grave.  The explosions may not have been as severe, and/or the attempts to extinguish 

the fire afterwards probably would have succeeded.       

450.  Finally, the Court notes that Captain  Kuchta’s  training  deficits  manifested  in ways 

other  than  the  failure  to  activate  EDS,  although  they  may  not  have  resulted  in  any  greater 

damage, injuries, or loss of life.  At 9:53 p.m., the DPO took it upon herself to issue the first of 

multiple  “Mayday”  calls  and  activated  the  Global  Maritime  Distress  Safety  System  (“GMDSS”).    

These actions were entirely appropriate given that the rig had sustained at least two explosions, 

had  lost  power,  a  massive  fire  raged,  and  areas  of  the  rig  were  already  destroyed  and/or 

inaccessible.    Nevertheless,  Captain  Kutcha  verbally  reprimanded  the  DPO  for  sending  the 

distress signals.  The evidence also reflects that the Chief Mate and the Senior DPO were doing a 

better job of taking charge of the situation than the Captain.  The Chief Mate had to physically 

bring the master outside the bridge and show him the fire in order for the Captain to agree with 

the  Chief  Mate  that  the  rig  needed  to  be  abandoned.      BP’s   marine   safety   expert,   Captain  

Mitchell, commented,  “I  find  that  quite  inconceivable  that  somebody  who  is  the  captain  of  the  

ship and who had been in this situation has to be told the gravity of the situation by his junior 

officer.”153 

Other  Actions  by  the  HORIZON’s  Crew  Following  the  Explosions 

 
ii.
451.  Despite  the  master’s  initial failings,  the  Court  finds  the  HORIZON’s  crew  acted  

appropriately  and  bravely  in  the  face  of  chaotic  circumstances  that  are,  frankly,  difficult  to 

genuinely understand.

452.  As mentioned above, the bridge crew advised the M/V DAMON BANKSTON to 

move away from the rig prior to the explosions.  After the explosions, the Senior DPO requested 

the BANKSTON to retrieve men from the water who had jumped overboard.   

453.  The DPO, Senior DPO, and the Chief Mate all attempted to activate the general 

alarm.  Although this did not happen until after the first explosion, it has not been shown that any 

delay in sounding the alarm caused or contributed to any injuries or deaths, the oil spill, etc. 

454.  The  DPO  and  Senior  DPO  made   several   announcements   over   the   rig’s   public  

address system including that there was a fire aboard the rig, all persons needed to muster, and 

later  to  abandon  the  rig.    As  mentioned  above,  the  DPOs  issued  multiple  distress  calls  and 

activated the GMDSS.   

455.  There  were  multiple  instances  of  heroic  acts  that  no  doubt  saved  the  lives  of 

several injured persons.  For example, after digging himself out of debris in what had been the 

accommodations  area  of  the  rig,  Senior  Toolpusher  Randy  Ezell  found  Wyman  Wheeler  and 

Buddy  Trahan,  both  of  whom  were  partially  buried  in  debris  and  seriously  injured.  Mr.  Ezell 

uncovered both men.  Other crewmates soon arrived with a stretcher and evacuated Mr. Trahan, 

whose injuries were the most serious.  Mr. Ezell tried to lift Mr. Wheeler and walk him out by 

himself, but Wheeler was too injured to be moved without a stretcher.   Wheeler told Ezell to 

leave him behind, but Ezell refused and instead waited with his crewmate for another stretcher to 

arrive, all while the rig burned about them.  Eventually another stretcher appeared and Wheeler 

was evacuated.   

456.  115  of  the  126  people  aboard  the  HORIZON  survived  the  events  of  April  20, 

2010.    Furthermore,  it  appears  that  everyone  who  survived  the  initial  explosions  managed  to 

 

108 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 109 of 153

evacuate the rig.  This is a testament to the safety training that Transocean did implement aboard 

its rig.   

457.  Even though half of the HORIZON’s  lifeboats and life rafts could not be accessed 

due to the fire, the overwhelming majority of evacuees were able to escape the rig via the two 

forward lifeboats.  The record reflects the lifeboats waited as long as reasonably possible before 

deploying, which gave many the opportunity to board.  The lifeboats deployed around 10:19 p.m. 

and 10:25 p.m.   

458.  Four  people  jumped  roughly  75  feet  into  the  sea  before  the  lifeboats  were 

launched.    The  Court  agrees  with  Mr.  Wolfe’s   conclusion  that  “[i]t   is   a   true   testament   to   the  

crew’s   training   and   safety   culture   that   only   these   individuals   jumped  prior  to  any  lifesaving 

appliance  being  launched.”154   

459.  After the lifeboats launched, seven people evacuated in one of the three forward 

life rafts.  These people were largely delayed because they were busy helping others evacuate.  

Notably, Mr. Ezell and Mr. Wheeler, who was in a stretcher, evacuated in this raft.   

460.  The  Court  further  notes  that  Captain  Kuchta,  despite  his  earlier  actions,  acted 

nobly  later.    The  life  raft  was  launched  by  Captain  Kuchta  and  the  Senior  DPO,  Yancy 

Keplinger.    Consequently,  these  were  the  two  last  people  on  board  the  HORIZON,  and  they 

evacuated by jumping into the water.  Once in the water, the life raft remained tied to the rig by a 

painter (rope).  Some people jumped into the water to swim away from the intense heat.  A fast 

rescue boat from the BANKSTON was nearby, but could not approach the raft due to fire on the 

water.  Captain Kuchta swam to the fast rescue boat, retrieved a knife, swam back to the raft, and 

cut it free so the raft and those in it could be towed to safety.

Alarm Systems and Rig Maintenance 
 
461.  The Court heard much testimony about the configuration of various detection and 

General Alarm, Emergency Shut Down, and Other Alarms 

alarm systems on the HORIZON.   

462.  The general alarm system was configured to require manual activation, but also 

would automatically  activate if another alarm, such as a  gas alarm, went unacknowledged for 

two minutes.  The Court finds this configuration was not improper and complied with applicable 

law.   

463.  The  HORIZON’s  fire  and  gas  detection  system  included  an  Emergency  Shutdown 

System  designed  to  initiate  certain  shutdown  actions.    Some  aspects  of  the  Shutdown  system 

were automatic; others required manual activation.  Given that the HORIZON was a dynamically 

positioned MODU that relied on its thrusters to maintain position as well as drive off the well if 

needed,  the  Court  finds  that  the  configuration  of  the  Emergency  Shutdown  System  was  not 

improper.  Moreover, given the large amount of gas that reached the HORIZON and the multiple 

potential ignition points, it does not appear that these features, even if properly functioning and 

set entirely on automatic mode, would have prevented the explosions.   

Rig Maintenance 

 
ii.
464.  There was extensive testimony regarding the condition of the HORIZON.   

465.  There is no dispute that there were a number of overdue maintenance tasks on the 

HORIZON   on   April   20,   2010.      It   is   also   clear   that   the   HORIZON’s   maintenance   crew   had  

struggled over the years to keep up with maintenance.   

466.  However, other than the matters that have been already pointed out (e.g., the BOP 

control pod batteries), the maintenance issues did not cause the blowout, explosion, and oil spill.

Process Safety 
467.  There was much evidence and testimony at trial concerning process safety.   

468.  Process safety management is  a disciplined, highly  organized set of approaches 
and strategies designed to prevent catastrophic failures involving complex engineered, human-

based systems.  It attempts to prevent, control, and mitigate major accidents, including fires and 

explosions, and the uncontrolled release of toxic chemicals or hydrocarbons.  A proper process 

safety management system includes components dedicated to hazard identification, risk analysis, 

and  risk  management.    Whereas  personal  safety  focuses  on  preventing  injuries  to  individuals 

from  slips,  trips,  and  falls,  and  is  more  synonymous  with  occupational  safety,  process  safety 

relates to hazards that can cause or contribute to major accidents. 

469.  Having  considered  the  evidence,  the  Court  finds  that  BP  had  a  process  safety 

management system in place on April 20, 2010 and that it applied to the Macondo well and the 

DEEPWATER   HORIZON,   even   if   it   “applied”   to   the   HORIZON   by   virtue   of   adopting   and  

“bridging”  the  contractor’s  safety  management  system.     It  may  not  have  been  perfect,  but  the  

evidence has not shown that it was defective or a cause of the blowout, explosion, and fire.

IV.  CONCLUSIONS OF FACT AND LAW 155 

470.  As  explained  in  the  Findings  of  Fact,  the  Phase  One  trial  concerned  two  cases 

within  this  Multidistrict  Litigation:  the  Transocean  entities’  limitation action (Civ. A. No. 10-

2771)  and  the  United  States’  claims under the Clean Water Act (“CWA”)156 and Oil Pollution 

Act of 1990 (“OPA”)  (Civ. A. No. 10-4563).  The Phase One trial addressed fault allocation for 

the loss of well control, blowout, explosion, fire, and oil spill.  This includes determining if any 

Defendant engaged in misconduct in excess of ordinary negligence.  The Phase One trial also 

addressed Transocean’s  limitation  defense, as well as various claims and defenses between and 

among the several Defendants.  The Phase One trial did not address efforts to stop the spill or 

how much oil entered the water, which are subjects of the Phase Two trial.  Phase One also did 

not address the amount of any civil penalties owed under the CWA, which is the subject of the 

“Penalty  Phase”  currently  scheduled  for  January  20,  2015. 
A. 

Jurisdiction  
471.  The Court previously ruled that the DEEPWATER HORIZON was a “vessel,”  as 

that term is used in maritime law, even though it was temporarily attached to the Macondo well 

by  the  BOP  stack  and  marine  riser—both  appurtenances  of  the  vessel—when  the  blowout, 

explosions, and fire occurred.157   

                                                 

155  Some of the conclusions listed here are factual determinations, others are legal conclusions.  Factual and 

legal conclusions shall be treated as such, regardless of how they are labeled.

DEEPWATER HORIZON is a vessel.  See In Re: Deepwater Horizon, 745 F.3d 157, 166 (5th Cir. Feb. 24, 2014),

472.  The Court also previously ruled that there is admiralty jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 

1333(1), and jurisdiction  under  the  Outer  Continental  Shelf  Lands  Act  (“OCSLA”),  43  U.S.C.  §  

1349, over Transocean’s limitation action and the claims asserted therein.158 

473.  The evidence from the Phase One trial lends further support to these rulings.   

474.  Although  not  previously  stated,  the  Court  finds  there  is  admiralty  and  OCSLA 

jurisdiction  over  the  United  States’  claims  as  well.    The  United  States’ claims also give rise to 

jurisdiction under the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1321(b)(7)(E) & (n), and OPA, 33 U.S.C. § 2707(b).   
B. 

Liability Under the Clean Water Act   
475.  The United States seeks civil penalties against BP Exploration & Production, Inc. 

(“BPXP”)  for violating the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1321(b)(7).  BPXP is the only BP entity named as 

a  defendant  in  the  United  States’  complaint.159   

476.  The CWA imposes a civil penalty upon “[a]ny  person  who  is  the  owner,  operator,  

or  person  in  charge  of  any  vessel,  onshore  facility,  or  offshore  facility  from  which  oil  .  .  .  is 

discharged in violation of paragraph (3) . . . .”160

the Motions to Dismiss the B1 Master Complaint] at 7-8, Rec. Doc. 3830, 808 F. Supp. 2d 943, 951 (E.D. La. Aug.

Stigma, BP Dealer, and Recreation Claims] at 22, Rec. Doc. 7526, 902 F. Supp. 808, 824 (E.D. La. Oct. 1, 2012).  
The Fifth Circuit has held that there is admiralty jurisdiction and/or OCSLA jurisdiction over claims by Louisiana 
coastal parishes for injuries to wildlife in Louisiana waters that were allegedly caused by the oil spill.  See In Re: 
Deepwater Horizon, 745 F.3d 157, 163-64, 166 (5th Cir. Feb. 24, 2014), petition for cert. filed, 82 U.S.L.W. 3698 
(May 23, 2014) (13-1424).   

159 The  United  States  also  sued  Transocean  and  BP’s  co-lessees, MOEX and Anadarko, for CWA violations.  
However,  Transocean  and  MOEX  settled  with  the  United  States.    Anadarko  and  MOEX  were  not  parties  to  the 
Phase One trial.   Accordingly, the Court does not address here the CWA liability vel non of Transocean, MOEX, or 
Anadarko.   
160 33 U.S.C. § 1321(b)(7)(A).  Paragraph  (3)  prohibits  the  discharge  of  “harmful”  quantities  of  oil  into  covered  
waters or in connection with OCSLA activities.  Id. §  1321(b)(3).    This  includes  discharges  that  “[v]iolate  applicable  
water  quality  standards”  or  “[c]ause a film or sheen upon or discoloration of the surface of the water or adjoining 
shorelines  or  cause  a  sludge  or  emulsion  to  be  deposited  beneath  the  surface  of  the  water  or  upon  adjoining 
shorelines.”    40  C.F.R.  §  110.3(b).    It  is  not  disputed  that  this  oil  spill  violated  paragraph (3).

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 114 of 153

477.  The Court previously held that BPXP is liable for civil penalties under the CWA, 

as  it  was  the  “owner”  of  an  “offshore  facility”  (the  Macondo  well)  “from  which  oil 

discharged.”161   

478.  The  Court’s  prior  ruling  did  not  determine  the  amount  of  the  CWA  penalty,  and  

the Court does not do so today.  What is decided here  is  whether  or  not  the  discharge  “was  the  

result of gross negligence or willful misconduct,”  which  determines the maximum amount of the 

penalty.162   

479. 

In  the  absence  of  gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  (i.e.,  if  the  defendant 

acted with ordinary negligence or was not negligent), the maximum amount of the CWA civil 

penalty is $1,100 per barrel of oil discharged.163  However, the maximum amount per barrel is 

nearly quadrupled when the discharge results from gross negligence or willful misconduct.164 

480.  As explained below, the Court finds and concludes that the discharge of oil was 

the  result  of  BPXP’s  “gross  negligence”  and  “willful  misconduct”  under  the  CWA. 

i.

Legal Standard Re: “Gross  Negligence”  and  “Willful  Misconduct”   

 
481.  Formulating the standard for gross negligence or willful misconduct is an issue of 

law.  Determining whether  or  not  BPXP’s  conduct  amounted  to negligence, gross negligence, or 

willful misconduct is an issue of fact.165 

                                                 

161 Order and Reasons [As to the Cross-Motions for Partial Summary Judgment Regarding Liability under the 
CWA and OPA] at 23-24, Rec. Doc. 5809, 844 F. Supp. 2d 746, 761 (E.D. La. Feb. 22, 2012).  A panel of the Court 
of Appeals recently affirmed this ruling.  In re Deepwater Horizon, --- F.3d ---, 2014 WL 2519040 (5th Cir. June 4, 
2014).  Petitions for rehearing were pending at the time of this writing.  

162 33 U.S.C. § 1321(b)(7)(D).   
163 The statutory amount is $1,000 per barrel.  33 U.S.C. § 1321(b)(7)(A).  Federal regulations increased this to 

$1,100.  40 C.F.R. § 19.4; 33 C.F.R. § 27.3.   

164  The  statutory  maximum  in  the  case  of  gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  is  $3,000.    33  U.S.C.  § 
1321(b)(7)(D).    One  federal  regulation  increased  this  amount  to  $4,000.    A  different  regulation  increased  it  to 
$4,300.  40 C.F.R. § 19.4; 33 C.F.R. § 27.3.  The Court does not decide at this time which regulation applies.

482.  The  CWA  does  not  define  “gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct.”    The United 

States and BP disagree over the meaning of “gross negligence,” but more or less agree over the 

meaning of  “willful  misconduct.”  

483.  The Government urges that gross negligence, like ordinary negligence, requires 

only  objective,  not  subjective,  proof.    While  ordinary  negligence  is  a  failure  to  exercise  the 

degree  of  care  that  someone  of  ordinary  prudence  would  have  exercised  in  the  same 

circumstances,  gross  negligence  is  an  extreme  departure  from  the  care  required  under  the 

circumstances or  a failure to  exercise even slight care.   Thus, the United States contends that 

gross negligence differs from ordinary negligence only in degree, not in kind.   

484.  BP urges that gross negligence has objective and subjective elements.  Like the 

United  States,  BP  contends  that  gross  negligence  requires  an  extreme  departure  from  the 

ordinary standard of care (objective element).  However, BP also claims that the actor must have 

what BP calls a  “culpable  mental  state”  (subjective  element).    According  to  BP,  the  subjective  

element requires that the actor must have actual, subjective awareness of the risk involved, but 

nevertheless proceed with conscious indifference to the rights, safety, or welfare of others.   

485.  The  United  States  and  BP  generally  agree  over   the   meaning   of   “willful 

misconduct.”     

486.  According to the Government, willful misconduct is  

an  act,  intentionally  done,  with  knowledge  that  the  performance  will  probably 
result  in  injury,  or  done  in  such  a  way  as  to  allow  an  inference  of  a  reckless 
disregard of the probable consequences. If the harm results from an omission, the 
omission must be intentional, and the actor must either know the omission will 
result in damage or the circumstances surrounding the failure to act must allow an 
implication of a reckless disregard of the probable consequences.166

166 United  States’  Proposed  Conclusion  of  Law  ¶  10,  Rec.  Doc.  10460-2 (quoting Tug Ocean Prince, v. United 

 

115 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 116 of 153

487.  BP claims that willful misconduct, like gross negligence, requires a culpable state 

of mind; however, willful  misconduct  “entails  an  even  more  culpable  state  of  mind  than  ‘gross  

negligence.’”    BP  states  that  “[w]illful  misconduct includes the defendant actually intending to 

cause injury (actual intent), as well as the defendant knowing that its conduct will naturally or 

probably  cause  injury  (constructive  intent  or  recklessness).”167  

488.  Restating the  parties’  positions  in terms of “recklessness”  helps frame the issue.  

Courts   often   use   “reckless”   to   refer   to   conduct   that   “is   not   intentional   or   malicious,   nor   is   it  

necessarily callous toward the risk of harming others, as opposed to unheedful of it.”168  Under 

BP’s   proposed   rubric,   “gross  negligence”  and  “recklessness”  are  treated  as  synonyms;  BP’s  

definition  of  “willful  misconduct”  also  includes  reckless  conduct,  but  extends  to  intentional 

misconduct as well.  Thus,  BP  places  reckless  conduct  in  both  “gross  negligence”  and  “willful  

misconduct.”   The  United  States  avoids  this  overlap  by  confining  “reckless”  to  “willful  

misconduct”  (which,  like  BP’s  definition, also extends to intentional conduct).  

489.  Turning  to  the  statutory  language,  the  Court  notes  that  the  phrase   “gross 

negligence or willful misconduct”  is  disjunctive, which suggests that these terms have distinct 

meanings  under  the  statute.    This  tends  to  support  the  United  States’  position.     

490.  OPA’s   text   makes   clear   that   “gross   negligence”   and   “willful   misconduct”   are  

distinct  forms  of  conduct.    One   section   of   OPA   states   that   “gross   negligence   or   willful  

misconduct”   will   lift   the   limits   of   liability.169    Another  section  of  OPA  states  that  “willful  

misconduct”  by a responsible party will provide the  responsible  party’s  guarantor with a defense

to  liability,   without   reference   to   “gross   negligence.”170    Because  only  “willful  misconduct” 

creates this defense, OPA  treats  “willful  misconduct”  as  distinct  from,  and  more  egregious  than,  

“gross  negligence.”171 

491. 

 “Gross   negligence”   and   “willful   misconduct”   have  the  same  meanings  under 

OPA and the CWA.172  Thus, the CWA also treats “willful misconduct” as conduct distinct from, 

and more egregious than, “gross negligence.” 

492.  Because   “gross   negligence”   and   “willful   misconduct”   are   distinct   under  the 

CWA, “reckless” conduct cannot be included in both terms.  Given that the United States and BP 

agree  that   reckless   conduct   is   included   in   “willful   misconduct,”173  reckless  conduct  cannot  be 

included  in  “gross  negligence.”  Therefore,  the  United  States’  definitions must be correct.  

493.  The  “cluster  of  ideas”  surrounding  gross  negligence  also  supports  this  conclusion.  

When Congress inserts a legal term of art into a statute, “it  presumably  knows  and  adopts  the 

cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it 

was  taken  and  the  meaning  its  use  will  convey  to  the  judicial  mind  unless  otherwise 

instructed.”174  A related idea is that courts: 

                                                 
170 33 U.S.C. § 2716(f)(1)(C).   
171 See Russello v. United States,  464  U.S.  16,  23  (1983)  (“[W]here  Congress includes particular language in 
one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts 
intentionally  and  purposely  in  the  disparate  inclusion  or  exclusion.” (citation and quotations omitted; alteration in 
original)).   
172 It  is  no  coincidence  that  OPA  and  the  CWA  both  use  “gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct.”    Prior  to  
OPA,  the  CWA’s   standard  for   increased   maximum  penalties   was   “willful negligence  or   willful   misconduct.”    33  
U.S.C.  §  1321(b)(6)(B)  (1988)  (emphasis  added).    OPA  changed  this  to  “gross negligence  or  willful  misconduct.”

173 The cases interpreting  “wilful  misconduct”  under  the  CWA  and  OPA  support  the  conclusion  that  the  term  
includes reckless conduct.  See Tug Ocean Prince, Inc. v. United States, 584 F.2d 1151, 1163 (2d Cir. 1978)); Water

.  .  .  generally  assume,  in  the  absence  of  a  plain  indication  to  the  contrary,  that 
Congress when it enacts a statute is not making the application of the federal act 
dependent on state law.  That assumption is based on the fact that the application 
of  federal  legislation  is  nationwide  and  at  times  on  the  fact  that  the  federal 
program would be impaired if state law were to control.175 

 
Because  the  CWA  is  a  federal  statute  that  applies  uniformly  across  all  states,  interpreting  the 

statutory  terms  “gross  negligence”  and  “willful  misconduct”  is a matter of federal law and should 

be based on a uniform interpretation of the terms, as opposed to, for example, the tort law of the 

state where the conduct or spill occurred.176  A court may look generally to states’  laws  in an 

effort to divine  the  “cluster  of  ideas”  surrounding  a  term  like “gross  negligence,”  but it should 

not cherry-pick the law of a particular state.177     

494.  Both BP and the United States find cases that support their proposed definitions 
of   “gross   negligence.”178    This  is  unsurprising  considering  that  “‘[g]ross  negligence’   is  a 

nebulous  term  that  is  defined  in  a  multitude  of  ways,  depending  on  the  legal  context  and  the 

jurisdiction.”179    However,  when  the   “cluster   of   ideas”   surrounding   “gross   negligence”   is  

considered,  the  prevailing  notion  is  that  gross  negligence  differs  from  ordinary  negligence  in 

terms of degree, and both are different in kind from reckless, wanton, and willful misconduct.180

176 See Resolution Trust Corp. v. Diamond, 45 F.3d 665, 671-72 (2d Cir. 1995).   
177 Likewise, to the extent there is  an  established  definition  of  “gross  negligence”  under  maritime  law,  it  should  
not apply to the  CWA if the definition is  inconsistent  with the  “cluster  of  ideas”   surrounding that term.  This is 
because admiralty jurisdiction and jurisdiction under the CWA are not identical.  For example, it is conceivable that 
admiralty jurisdiction would not apply to an oil spill from an onshore facility into navigable waters, but the CWA 
would.    Thus,  just  as  no  single  state’s  law  should  define  a  standard  that  will  apply in other states, maritime law also 
should  not  necessarily  define  a  statutory  term  that  will  sometimes  apply  outside  admiralty’s  scope.

even  within  such  rule  or  statute  depending  on  the  facts.”  (footnotes  omitted)).

495.  Additional  support  comes  from  the  fact  that  the  pre-OPA  version  of  the  CWA 
used “willful negligence  or  willful  misconduct” as the standard for enhanced civil penalties.181  

The Fourth Circuit interpreted “willful  negligence” to mean “reckless  disregard  for  the  probable  

consequences   of   a   voluntary   act   or   omissions.”182    The  fact  that  OPA  replaced  “willful  

negligence”   with  “gross   negligence”   suggests   that   Congress  intended  a  different  and  lower 

standard to apply—particularly when considered with the fact that one purpose of OPA was to 

increase the deterrent effect civil penalties would have on oil spills.183  

                                                                                                                                                             
willful,  wanton,  or  reckless  conduct.    While  the  jurisdictions  adopting  this  distinction  consider  gross  negligence 
substantially and appreciably higher in magnitude than ordinary negligence, it  is still not equivalent to wanton or 
willful conduct and it does not encompass reckless behavior.  . . . Negative in nature, [gross negligence] implies an 
absence of care.  Willful misconduct, on the other hand, requires an intentional act or an intentional failure to act, 
either  with  knowledge  that  serious  injury  is  a  probable  result,  or  with  a  positive  and  active  disregard  for  the 
consequences.”);;   Id.  §   233   (“While,   in   theory,   gross   negligence   and   willful   and   wanton   misconduct   are   distinct  
concepts with different legal bases, in practice there has been much confusion and unfortunate overlap between the 
two doctrines.  Part of the difficulty stems from the fact that the labels are sometimes used interchangeably, with 
‘gross   negligence’   defined   in   ‘willful   and   wanton   misconduct’   terms.      The   designation   of   wanton   acts   as   ‘gross  
negligence’  is  a  misnomer,  because  such  acts  are  not  negligence  at  all.”);;  Id. §  235  (“In some jurisdictions, gross 
negligence  is  characterized  by  conscious  indifference  to  or  reckless  disregard  of  the  rights,  safety,  or  welfare  or 
others,  or  to  the  probable  consequences  of  one’s  acts.”);;  Id. §  244  (“Many jurisdictions consider willful, wanton, or 
reckless conduct to be conduct of a different kind than negligence.  Thus, it has been said that willful, malicious, or 
intentional   misconduct   is   not   properly   speaking,   within   the   meaning   of   ‘negligence,’   however  gross,  when 
‘negligence’  is  used  as  a  term  of  art.”);;  Restatement  (Third)  of  Torts  §  2,  Cmt.  a  (2010)  (“Taken  at  face  value,  this  
term  [gross  negligence]  simply  means  negligence  that  is  especially  bad.    Given  this  literal  interpretation,  gross 
negligence   carries   a   meaning   that   is   less   than   recklessness.”);;   Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts  §  34,  at 
211012  (5th  ed.  1984)  (“As  it  originally appeared, [gross negligence] was very great negligence, or the want of even 
slight  or  scant  care.  .  .  .  Several  courts,  however,  dissatisfied  with  a  term  so  nebulous  .  .  .  have  construed  gross 
negligence as requiring willful, wanton, or reckless misconduct, or such utter lack of all care as will be evidence 
thereof . . . But it is still true that most courts consider  that  ‘gross  negligence’  falls  short  of  a  reckless  disregard  of  
the  consequences,  and  differs  from  ordinary  negligence  only  in  degree,  and   not   in   kind.”).    Emphasis  in  the 
foregoing parentheticals has been added; footnotes have been omitted.  Additional support can be found in Baker, 
where the Supreme  Court,  after surveying punitive damage cases from across the  nation,  appeared to view  gross 
negligence as a concept distinct from, and less blameworthy than, recklessness.  See Baker, 554 U.S. at 512 (1990) 
(“These  studies  cover  cases  of  the  most  as  well  as  the  least  blameworthy  conduct  triggering  punitive  liability,  from  
malice and avarice, down to recklessness, and even gross negligence in  some  jurisdictions.”).

183 This purpose is reflected in the fact that OPA dramatically increased the amount of CWA civil penalties and 
removed the requirement for enhanced penalties that the extra-negligent  conduct  be  within  the  owner’s  “privity  and  
knowledge.”    Cf. 33 U.S.C. § 1321(b)(6)(B) (1988).  This purpose is also apparent from the legislative history.  See

496.  BP attempts to find support in the congressional debates over OPA.  BP quotes 

Representative Synar, who remarked, “‘[G]ross negligence and willful misconduct . . . is conduct 

that  is  intended  to  injure  or  is  reckless,  showing  the  wanton  disregard  for  the  harm  to  others 

which is the likely result of a certain course of action or activity. . . .  The[se] are extraordinarily 

difficult to prove.’”184  However, BP omits language that supports the  Government’s  position.  

BP’s   second  set  of  ellipses  replaced  the  Representative’s   comments   that  “Gross  negligence  is 

considered  by  the  courts  to  be  an  extreme  departure  from  reasonable  conduct.    Willful 

misconduct  requires  proof  of  an  element  of  conscious  intent.”185    Likewise,  BP  quotes 

Representative  Miller,  who  said,  “Both   [gross   negligence   and   willful   misconduct]   are   very  

difficult  to  prove,”  but  BP fails to mention the very next sentence, “Prosser on Torts describes 

gross negligence as the failure to exercise even that care which a careless  person  would  use.”186  

Nor   does   BP   mention   Representative   Gejdenson’s   statement,   “[T]he  definition  of  gross 

negligence  that  this  legislation  uses  to  determine  whether  the  liability  caps  are  broken  is:  ‘A.  The  

failure to exercise a standard of care which  even  a  careless  person  would  exercise.’”187  When 

considered as a whole, the most BP could fairly state about these debates is that they provide 

conflicting views on how gross negligence is defined.          

497.  After  post-trial  briefing  was  complete,  the  Fifth  Circuit  issued  its  opinion  in 
United  States  v.  Citgo  Petroleum  Corp.188    There   the   question   of   how   “gross   negligence”   is

defined under the CWA was presented.189  However, Citgo’s  answer  is  vague, as explained in the 

margin.190   

498.  For  the  reasons  stated,  the  Court  believes  that  the  United  States  provides  the 

correct  definitions  of   “gross   negligence”   and   “willful   misconduct”   for  purposes  of  the  CWA.  
However, because it is unclear what standard Citgo may have applied, the Court will also assume 

that “gross negligence” is  equivalent  to  “recklessness” and analyze the facts under that standard 

as well.   

Findings Re: “Gross  Negligence”  or  “Willful  Misconduct” (Single Act) 

 
ii.
499.  Based  on  the  Court’s   findings   and   as   further   explained   below,  the  Court 

concludes that the discharge of oil “was the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct” by 

BPXP  under  the  CWA,  33  U.S.C.  §  1321(b)(7)(D).    The  Court  finds  that  BPXP  acted 

                                                 

189 See id. at 554-55. 
190 Citgo concerned  the  United  States’  CWA  civil  penalty  claim  against  a  refinery  owner  after  its  wastewater  
storage tanks failed and discharged oil into surrounding waterways.  The district court began its analysis of whether 
the  defendant’s  conduct  amounted  to  gross  negligence  by  stating,  “Under  Louisiana  law,  gross  negligence  is  willful,  
wanton,  and  reckless  conduct  that  falls  between  intent  to  do  wrong  and  ordinary  negligence.”    Id. at 554 (internal 
quotes  and  alterations  omitted).    The  district  court  concluded  that  the  defendant  was  negligent,  but  not  grossly 
negligent.  The United States argued on appeal that the lower court erroneously applied a state-law standard that 
equated gross negligence with willful misconduct.   

 
The  Fifth  Circuit’s  response  began  with  language  that  could  be  interpreted  as  equating  “gross  negligence”  with  

“willful,  wanton,  or  reckless  conduct,”  which  would  tend  to  support  BP’s  position: 

“Gross negligence” is a label that straddles the divide between intentional and accidental actions.  
The  Louisiana  Supreme  Court  has  said  that  “often  [there  is]  no  clear  distinction  between  such 
willful, wanton,  or  reckless  conduct  and  ‘gross’  negligence,  and  the  two  have  tended to merge and 
take  on  the  same  meaning.”  We  see  no  error  in  the  district  court’s  articulation  of  its  understanding  
of this term that is neither fish nor foul. 
 

Id.  (quoting  Brown  v.  ANA  Ins.  Grp.,  994  So.  2d  1265,  1269  n.7  (La.  2008).    However,  Citgo  concludes  its 
discussion with language that appears to reject the Louisiana law definition: 
 

It does not appear that the district court relied on the state-law definition anyway.  After it offered 
the  state-law  definition  of  gross  negligence,  the  district  court   stated   that   “it  does  not  find  that 
CITGO’s  actions  or  inactions  rise  to  the  level  of  gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct”  and  “the 
Court  finds  no  gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  on   the   part   of   CITGO.”    Given  these 
subsequent statements, we conclude the district court applied the correct legal standard.

“recklessly;;”  therefore, regardless of whether the  CWA’s  definition  of  “gross  negligence”  is the 

same  as  or  lesser  than  “recklessness,”  that  standard is met.  Additionally, because it is undisputed 

that  “willful  misconduct”  includes  “reckless”  conduct,  that  standard  is  also  met.   

500.  The Court is mindful of the concept that  “[a]  greater  degree  of  care is required 

when  the  circumstances  present  a  greater  apparent  risk.”191    A  corollary  here  is  that  similar 

actions or omissions may be judged as meeting the standard of care,  or falling just below the 

standard of care, or an extreme departure from the standard of care, depending on the context in 

which the action or omission occurred.192     

501.  Turning  to  the  case  at  bar,  the  industry  and  BP  recognized  that  a  blowout, 

explosion,  and  oil  spill  are  potential  harms  associated  with  offshore  drilling.    Obviously,  the 

magnitude of this potential harm is great in terms of severity, which in turn raises the standard of 

care.193   

502.  The Macondo well was drilled in deepwater, which adds certain complexities not 

found  in  shallower  waters  or  onshore.    Furthermore,  the  high  pressure  and  high  temperature 

characteristics  of  the  geological  formation  into  which  the  Macondo  well  was  drilled  added 

                                                 

191  See  Water  Quality  Ins.  Syndicate  v.  United  States,  632  F.  Supp.  2d  108,  112  (D.  Mass.  2009)  (citation 
omitted)  (interpreting   “gross  negligence”  under  OPA);;  Restatement  (Third)  of  Torts  §  2,  cmt.  d  (2010)  (“[I]f  the  
[magnitude of the foreseeable] risk [of harm] is somewhat greater than the burden [of precautions that can eliminate 
the risk], the actor is negligent for failing to adopt the precaution.  . . . When, however, the imbalance between the 
magnitude of the foreseeable risk and the burden of precaution becomes sufficiently large, that imbalance indicates 
that  the  actor’s  conduct  is  substantially  worse  than  ordinary  negligence.”  (emphasis  added)).     
192  Justice  Story  illustrated   this   point   with   his   “bag   of   apples.”      See Tracy v. Wood,  24  F.  Cas.  117  (Story, 
Circuit  Justice,  C.C.D.R.I.  1822)  (No.  14,130)  (bailment  case)  (“If a bag of apples were left in a street for a short 
time, without a person to guard it, it would certainly not be more than ordinary neglect. But if the bag were of jewels 
or gold, such conduct would be gross negligence. In short, care and diligence are to be proportional to the value of 
the goods, the temptation and facility of stealing them, and the danger of losing them.”). 
193  This  is  partially  reflected  in  the  MMS  regulations,  which  required  BPXP  to,  inter  alia,  “protect   health,  
safety,  property,  and  the  environment  by  .  .  .  [p]erforming  all  operations  in  a  safe  and  workmanlike  manner,”   30 
C.F.R.  §  250.107(a),  “use   the   best   available   and   safest   technology   .   .   .   whenever   practical   on   all   exploration,  
development,   and   production   operations,”   id.  §   250.107(c),   “take   measures   to   prevent   unauthorized   discharge   of  
pollutants into the offshore waters [and] . . . not create conditions that will pose unreasonable risk to public health, 
life,   property,   aquatic   life,   wildlife,   [etc.],”   id.  §   250.3000,   and   “take   necessary   precautions   to   keep   wells   under  
control at all times [including] . . . use[ing] the best available and safest drilling technology to monitor and evaluate 
well conditions and minimize the potential  for  the  well  to  flow  or  kick,”  id. § 250.401.

complexity that is not present in all deepwater wells.  These features increased the chance that a 

blowout,  explosion,  and  oil  spill  would  occur,  which,  in  turn,  further  raises  the  standard  of 

care.194          

503.  This  is  not  to  say  that  every  activity  on  a  MODU  or  decision  relating  to  a 

deepwater well is of a nature that any unreasonable act or decision is automatically treated as an 

extreme  departure  from  the  standard  of  care.195    The  negative  pressure  test,  however,  was  a 

particularly critical part of the temporary abandonment operation.196  As previously explained, 

the  negative  pressure  test  is  a  safety-critical  test.    Its  purpose  was  to  determine  whether  the 

cement and casing had successfully isolated the well from the reservoir, so that the heavy drilling 

mud—which  otherwise  prevented  hydrocarbons  from  flowing  into  the  well—could  be  safely 

removed.    Therefore,  the  risk  of  foreseeable  harm  associated  with  misinterpreting  a  negative 

pressure test was great both in terms of severity and probability.   

504.  Furthermore, interpreting the negative pressure test is relatively straightforward.  

It  is  a   “pass-or-fail”  test;  inconclusive  or  contradictory  results  mean  the  test  has  failed.    This 

reduces  the  likelihood  that  a  misinterpretation  is  an  “honest  mistake”  or  “mere  inadvertence.”197      

                                                 

194    Indeed,  Dr.  Tony  Hayward,  the  C.E.O.  of  BP  p.l.c.  in  2010  (and  who  began  his  career  with  BP  as  a 
geologist),  described  deepwater  mineral  exploration  as  “akin  to  outer  .  .  .  space  exploration.”    Hayward  Deposition,  
872:8-11.  Dr. Hayward estimated that BP was drilling roughly 20 deepwater wells around the world on April 20, 
2010.  Id. 873:6.  He further  estimated  that,  at  most,  5  of  these  wells  were  considered  “higher  risk”  due  to  the  nature  
of  their  geologic  formation.    Id.  at  875:1-19.      BP   classified   Macondo   as   one   of   these   5   “higher   risk”   deepwater  
wells.    
195  See, e.g., Houston Exploration Co. v. Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc., 269 F.3d 528, 532-33 (5th Cir. 2001) 
(holding  under  Louisiana  law  that  a  tool  operator’s  failure  to  verify  that  a  valve  had  been  pinned,  which  resulted  in  a  
blowout, did not constitute gross negligence because, inter alia, the record did not show that a tool operator would 
anticipate that an improperly pinned valve would contribute to a well blowout, given that the valve at issue was not 
designed to function as a well control device).   

196  The negative pressure test is discussed in Parts III.H.ii-v, supra. 
197  Mere  inadvertence  or  honest  mistake  do  not  amount  to  gross  negligence  under  any  standard.    See,  e.g., 
Houston Exploration, 269 F.3d at  532  (noting  under  Louisiana  law  that  “[m]ere  inadvertence  or  honest  mistake  does 
not   amount   to   gross   negligence.”);;   57A   Am.   Jur.   2d   Negligence  §   227   (“‘Gross   negligence’   means   more   than  
momentary  thoughtlessness,  inadvertence  or  error  of  judgment  .  .  .  .”  (footnotes  omitted)).

505. 

  BP,  as  the  operator,  was  ultimately  responsible  for  interpreting  the  negative 

pressure test and declaring it a success or failure.  Don Vidrine, the BP Well Site Leader on the 

rig, concluded the test was successful and instructed the Transocean rig crew to fully displace the 

well  to  seawater,  despite  the  fact  that  he  would  later  tell  investigators  that  the  results  looked 

“squirrely”   to   him.    All  of  the  experts—even   BP’s—agree  that  Vidrine’s   interpretation   was  

erroneous and that the test could not be deemed successful.  A reasonable company man198 in 

Vidrine’s   situation   would   have  concluded  that  the  test  was  a  failure  and  that  it  needed  to  be 

reconducted based on the anomalous pressure reading.   

506.  Moreover, about an hour after the test concluded, Mark Hafle, BP’s  senior  drilling  

engineer in Houston, told Vidrine essentially that the test could not be considered a success given 

the inconsistent pressure readings.  At this point, Vidrine should have been well-aware that the 

negative test had failed.  Significantly, when that conversation ended at 9:02 p.m., there were 

approximately 36 minutes before the critical moment when hydrocarbons rose above the BOP—

plenty of time for Vidrine or Hafle to halt the displacement and order a new negative pressure 

test.   

507.  At 9:08 p.m., the displacement did stop, not because anyone wanted to re-conduct 

the  negative  pressure  test,  but  for  a  sheen  test.    Vidrine  had  to  approve  the  sheen  test  before 

displacement would resume.  Thus, the sheen test provided a perfect opportunity for Vidrine to 

order a new negative pressure test.  Instead, at 9:14 p.m., Vidrine—having the benefit  of  Hafle’s  

crucial  observation  about  the  negative  pressure  test—affirmatively  ordered  that  displacement 

resume.   

508.  Mark  Hafle  also  did  not  order  that  the  negative  pressure  test  be  reconducted.  

Granted, Hafle may have lacked some context given that he was in  BP’s  Houston  office.  To the 
                                                 

198 Recall  that  “company  man”  is  the  industry  term  for  “Well  Site  Leader.”    Supra note 43. 

 

124 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 125 of 153

extent this was the case, Hafle could have easily informed himself of either the current state of 

the  well  or  the  earlier  readings  from  the  negative  pressure  test  by  merely  looking  to  his 

computer, and then called the rig and ordered the displacement stopped and the test reconducted.   

Hafle did not do this, which is inexplicable considering not only his statements to Vidrine but 

also the fact that he felt there was little chance the cement job would succeed.199   

509.  The  last  sentence  illustrates  another  point:  context.    As  discussed,  a  negative 

pressure  test  conducted  as  part  of  a  temporary  abandonment  of  a  deepwater  well  already 

demands a high level of care, but the actual circumstances surrounding the Macondo well pushed 

the  standard  of  care  even  higher.    Vidrine  and  Hafle,  as  well  as  other  BPXP  operational  and 

engineering  personnel,  were  well-aware  that  the  Macondo  well  had  been  particularly 

troublesome  to  drill,200  and  difficulties  continued  throughout  the  temporary  abandonment 

process.  Notably, BPXP personnel, including but not limited to Vidrine and Hafle, were aware 

of the problems with converting the float collar.201  A foreseeable risk of these issues is that the 

cement would fail to achieve zonal isolation, either because the cement might u-tube back into 

the casing from the annulus (due to an unconverted float collar) or would not be placed in the 

appropriate place in the  annulus (due to a casing breach).   Vidrine  and   Hafle’s  knowledge of 

these difficulties and associated risks should have heightened their vigilance during the negative 

pressure test, given that it tests whether the cement and casing are providing a barrier to flow.   

510.  Vidrine  and  Hafle,  along  with  other  BPXP  personnel,  were  also  aware  of  BP 

decisions that added risks to either the cement job or the negative pressure test.  These included: 

the  decision  to  use  fewer  centralizers  than  recommended,  which  increased  the  risk  of  cement

channeling;202 the decision not to conduct a full bottoms-up circulation prior to the cement job, 

which increased the risk of cement contamination and/or channeling;203 the decision to pump a

pressure test given that it was the only remaining tool that could evaluate the effectiveness of the 

cement;207 and the decision to use an unorthodox LCM spacer during the displacement, which 

increased the risk that apertures in the BOP could become clogged.208  While not all of these 

decisions  may  have  contributed  to  the  ultimate  mode  of  failure,  and  perhaps  not  all  were 

necessarily unreasonable decisions (at least when viewed in isolation),  each of these decisions 

and their associated risks should have increased the caution surrounding the negative pressure 

test beyond the  “high  alert”  status  it already demanded. 

511.  Under the  definition relied upon by the United  States,  “gross  negligence”  is   an  

extreme departure from the care required under the circumstances or a failure to exercise even a 

slight care.  For the reasons explained, the negative pressure test at the Macondo well demanded 

a   level   of   care   exceeding   the   “high”   care   typically  required  during  such  a  test.    There  is  no 

dispute that this negative pressure test could not be considered a success.  Vidrine should have

understood  this  even  before  he  spoke  with  Hafle.    Hafle’s   comments   to   Vidrine  should  have 

confirmed what Vidrine should have already understood.  Conducting a new negative pressure 

test  is  a  precaution  that  imposed  an  extremely  light  burden  compared  to  the  foreseeable 

consequences  that  could,  and  did,  result  from  the  misinterpretation.    Consequently,   Vidrine’s  

misinterpretation  of  the  negative  pressure  test  and  subsequent  failure  to  order  a  new  one 

following his conversation with Hafle constitutes an extreme departure from the care required 

under the circumstances.  For  similar  reasons,  Hafle’s  failure  to  order  a  new  negative  pressure  

test, or pursue the issue further with Vidrine, or, at the very least, investigate the situation from 

his  computer,  also  constitutes  an  extreme  departure  from  the  care  required  under  the 

circumstances.   

512.  The   United   States’   and   BP’s   definitions  of   “willful   misconduct”   and   BP’s  

definition   of   “gross   negligence”   are   essentially   the   same   as   “recklessness,”  although   “willful  
misconduct”  may  also  include  intentional  misconduct.    The  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts 

provides  the  following  definition  of  “reckless”:     

The actor’s conduct is in reckless disregard of the safety of another if he does an 
act  or  intentionally  fails  to  do  an  act  which  it  is  his  duty  to  the  other  to  do, 
knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to 
realize, not only that his conduct creates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to 
another, but also that such risk is substantially greater than that which is necessary 
to make his conduct negligent.209 
 

The comments further explain: 

Recklessness may  consist  of either of two different types of conduct.  In 
one the actor knows, or has reason to know . . . of facts which create a high degree 
of risk of physical harm to another, and deliberately proceeds to act, or to fail to 

                                                 

209  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  §  500  (1965).    Although  the  Restatement  (Third)  has  superseded  this 
definition, the Court relies upon it because it was the version in effect when Congress passed OPA and because it 
was cited by the Supreme Court in Baker, 554 U.S. at 493-94.  Although Baker concerned maritime law—which 
does  not  necessarily  supply  a  standard  under  the  CWA—it  appears  the  Supreme  Court  drew  its  definition  of 
“reckless”  from  the  general  common  law.    This  Court  notes,  however,  that  the  differences  between  the  Restatement  
(Second) and Restatement (Third) are irrelevant for present purposes.   

 

127 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 128 of 153

act, in conscious disregard of, or indifference to, that risk. In the other the actor 
has  such  knowledge,  or  reason  to  know,  of  the  facts,  but  does  not  realize  or 
appreciate  the  high  degree  of  risk  involved,  although  a  reasonable  man  in  his 
position would do so.  
. . .  

For either type of conduct, to be reckless it must be unreasonable; but to 
be  reckless,  it  must  be  something  more  than  negligent.  It  must  not  only  be 
unreasonable, but it must involve a risk of harm to others substantially in excess 
of  that  necessary  to  make  the  conduct  negligent.  It  must  involve  an  easily 
perceptible danger of death or substantial physical harm, and the probability that 
it  will  so  result  must  be  substantially  greater  than  is  required  for  ordinary 
negligence.210 
 
513.  The Court finds that before Vidrine spoke with Hafle, Vidrine likely knew of facts 

(the  conflicting  pressures  during  the  negative  pressure  test)  that  would  have  led  a  reasonable 

company man in the industry to realize that deeming  the  negative  pressure  test  “successful”  and  

displacing the mud from the well would probably result in physical injuries, death, and severe 

property damage.  After speaking with Hafle, Vidrine absolutely knew of facts that would lead a 

reasonable company man to believe that not stopping the displacement and conducting a new test 

would  probably  result  in  physical  injuries,  death,  and  severe  property  damage.    However, 

Vidrine  did  not  stop  the  displacement;  instead,  he  affirmatively  ordered  that  the  displacement 

resume.       

514.  As  to  Hafle,  he  clearly  understood  that  inconsistent  pressures  indicated  the 

negative  pressure  test  had  failed,  but  he  was  arguably  uncertain  of  the  context.    However, 

because  he  also  understood  the  danger  associated  with  misinterpreting  this  test,  his  failure  to 

investigate, particularly given the ease with which he could have done so, similarly amounts to 

recklessness.

515.  Accordingly,   Hafle   and   Vidrine   acted   “recklessly”   with   respect   to   the   negative  

pressure  test,  which  satisfies  both  parties’  definitions  of  “willful  misconduct”  as   well  as  BP’s  

definition  of  “gross  negligence”  under  the  CWA.   

 
iii.

Findings   Re:   “Gross   Negligence”   or   “Willful   Misconduct”   (Multiple  Negligent 
Acts) 

516.  The analysis above focused on the negative pressure test as a single act of gross 

negligence and willful misconduct.   

517.  However, a series of negligent acts may also constitute gross negligence or willful 

misconduct under the CWA.211 

518.  Accordingly, the Court further finds and concludes that BPXP committed a series 

of  negligent  acts  or  omissions  that  resulted  in  the  discharge  of  oil,  which  together  amount  to 

gross negligence and willful misconduct under the CWA.  This is an additional and alternative 

grounds  for  finding  BPXP’s  conduct  amounted  to  gross  negligence  and  willful  misconduct.       

519.  BPXP’s negligent acts that caused the blowout, explosion, and oil spill include: 

drilling the final 100 feet of the well with little or no margin,212 running the production casing 
with the float collar in unconverted mode and without a shoe filter,213 failing to verify whether 

the float collar converted by reverse circulating the well,214 not conducting a CBL,215 using LCM 

as  a  spacer  for  the  displacement  and  negative  pressure  test,216  misinterpreting  the  negative 

pressure test,217 allowing simultaneous operations to occur during displacement,218 and failing to 

                                                 
211  See  Ocean  Prince,  584  F.2d  at  1163-64   (interpreting   “willful   misconduct”   under   CWA’s   provision  
concerning liability for removal costs); 57A Am. Jur. 2d Negligence §  229  (“[S]everal  connected or successive acts 
of  simple  negligence  may  support  a  finding  of  gross  negligence,  due  to  their  compounding  effect.”).

considered to be merely negligent, rather than gross negligence or worse.

provide  a  displacement  schedule  to  the  Transocean  drill  crew.219    Notably,  the  decisions 

regarding drilling the final 100 feet, the CBL, and LCM-spacer were profit-driven decisions. 

520. 

 These instances of negligence, taken together, evince an extreme deviation from 

the standard of care and a conscious disregard of known risks.  

521.  BPXP  was  also  negligent  by  pumping  foamed  cement  without  a  successful 

stability test.220  Although cement instability did not cause the actual mode of failure (given the 

Court’s  conclusion  that  the  cement  was  improperly  placed through a breach in the shoe track), it 

is  another  instance  of  BP  proceeding  in  the  face  of  a  known  risk  and  therefore  lends  further 

support to the conclusion  that  BP’s  conduct  was  reckless.   

iv.

Attribution 

 
522.  BP  asserts  that  BPXP  cannot  be  held  liable  for  enhanced  penalties  under  the 

CWA when the gross negligence or willful misconduct was committed by its employees; instead, 

BPXP  must  have  authorized  or  ratified  this  misconduct.    BP  contends  this  is  the  “traditional  

common-law rule” that applies to punitive damages, which, absent contrary statutory language, 

should  also  apply  to  the  CWA.    BP  supports  its  position  by  pointing  out  that  OPA  explicitly 

attributes  an   agent’s   or   employee’s   gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  to  the  corporate 

principal or employer for purposes of removing liability caps,221 but similar language does not 

appear in the CWA.  BP claims that this shows that Congress deliberately chose not to deviate 

from  the  “traditional  common-law  rule”  in  the  CWA.      

523.  The Court does not agree.

524.  The CWA states, in pertinent part, “In any case in which a [discharge of oil] was 

the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct of a person described in subparagraph (A), 

the  person  shall  be  subject  to  [higher  maximum  civil  penalties].”222    Subparagraph  (A)  is  the 

strict-liability penalty provision for non-negligent  and  negligent  conduct.    It  states,  “Any  person  

who is the owner, operator, or person in charge of any vessel . . . or offshore facility from which 

oil . . . is discharged . . . shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to . . . [$1,100].”223   

525. 

“Person”   is  defined  under  the  CWA  to  include  “corporations”   and   contains   no  

requirement to identify corporate management, officers, etc.224  The enhanced penalty provision, 

§  1321(b)(7)(D),  also  does  not  require  any  specific  level  of  corporate  management;  it  merely 

refers back to the entities that can be held strictly liable under the CWA.   

526.  Congress  could  have  added  a  requirement  that  corporate  management,  etc.,  be 

involved in order to obtain enhanced penalties, but it did not.  In fact, Congress actually removed 

similar requirements from the CWA when it passed OPA. 

527.  Prior to OPA, the CWA’s  provision  governing  civil  penalty  actions  established  a  

two-tier penalty structure, similar in some respects to the one in effect today.  Like the lower, 

strict-liability  penalty  in  the  current  version,  the  pre-OPA  CWA  stated  that  “[a]ny   owner,  

operator, or person in charge of any . . . offshore facility . . . [or] vessel from which oil . . . is 

discharged”  was  liable  for  a  civil  penalty  not exceeding $50,000.225  However, in order to access 

the higher maximum civil penalty of $250,000, the pre-OPA CWA required the Government to 

not only show that the discharge “was the result of willful negligence or willful misconduct,” but 
also that this conduct  was  “within the privity and knowledge of the owner, operator or person in

charge.”226  When OPA rewrote  the  CWA’s  civil  penalty  provisions,  it  removed the “privity  and  

knowledge” language.  

528. 

“Privity  and  knowledge”  under the former version of the CWA meant the same as 

it does under the Limitation of Liability Act.227  Courts applying the Limitation Act to corporate 

owners  interpret  “privity   and   knowledge”   to   mean   “the   privity   and   knowledge   of   a   managing  

agent, officer, or supervising employee, including shoreside  personnel.”228 Consequently, one of 

the most difficult issues that arise under the Limitation Act is whether the person responsible for 

the  error  is  sufficiently  high  up  in  the  corporate  hierarchy  that  her  acts  or  omissions  will  be 

deemed within the  owner’s  “privity  and  knowledge.”229   

529.  Thus, when OPA deleted “privity  and  knowledge”  from the CWA, it removed a 

significant  hurdle  to  accessing  higher  maximum  penalties:  no  longer  was  the  Government 

required to show that the extra-negligent conduct was committed by an employee of a certain 

rank or an agent with the requisite level of authority.230  BP’s  argument  would  replace the hurdle 

Congress deliberately removed with one even higher.      

530.  Additionally,  while  the  common-law   rule   regarding   a   corporation’s   punitive  

liability  may  have  been  clear  over  a  century  ago,231  that  was  certainly  not  the  case  when 

Congress  enacted  the  current  version  of  the  CWA’s  civil  penalty  provision,  nor  is  it  so  today.232

In fact, BP cites no cases that have applied its interpretation to the CWA, nor has the Court found 
any.  BP  relies  heavily  on  the  Fifth  Circuit’s  decision  in  In re: P&E Boat Rentals, Inc., which 

concerned punitive damages under maritime law.233  As explained above, however, maritime law 

does  not  necessarily  supply  a  standard  for  the  CWA,  which  may  not  always  overlap  with 
admiralty jurisdiction.234  Furthermore, other maritime circuits disagree with P&E Boats, and the 

Supreme Court was equally divided on this issue, which lends further supports to the point that 

by  1990,  the  general  common  law,  and  perhaps  general  maritime  law  as  well,  had  changed 

considerably  from  the  “traditional”  rule.235      

531.  For  these  reasons,  the  Court  concludes  that  a  corporation  is  vicariously  liable 

under  the  CWA’s  enhanced  penalty  provision  for  the  gross  negligence  and/or  willful  misconduct  

of  its  employees.    Consequently,  the  Court  need  not  determine  whether  BPXP  authorized  or 

ratified the conduct, or whether Vidrine and Hafle (or any other BP employee) were “managerial  

agents,”   or   any   other   attribution  standard  that  may  apply  under  general  maritime  law, 

“traditional”  common  law,  or  any  other  law  or  jurisdiction.   

Causation 

 
v.
532.  BP and the United States disagree over what level of causation is required under 

the CWA.   

533.  The  relevant  language  of  the  CWA  states,  “In  any  case  in  which  a  [discharge]  was 

the result of gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  .  .  .  .”236 

534.  The  United  States  contends  this  language  requires  only  “but  for”  causation.    BP  

argues  the  language  requires   a   “significant   causal   link”   or   “substantial   nexus,”   based   on   the  
                                                                                                                                                             
damages,  while  some  non-admiralty  and  admiralty  courts  require  that  the  agent  was  employed  in  a  managerial 
capacity, but most admiralty courts still require the employer to authorize or ratify the wanton act).

Supreme  Court’s  interpretation of an OCSLA provision that used similar language.237  BP further 

asserts  that  these  terms  are  akin  to  “proximate  cause.” 

535.  The Court need not decide this issue.  Its conclusions regarding gross negligence 

and  willful  misconduct  would  satisfy  a  proximate  cause  standard,  assuming  such  a  standard 

applied.   

vi.

Additional  Bases  for  BPXP’s  Clean  Water  Act  Liability 

 
536.  The  Court  previously  defined  “operator”   under  the  CWA.238    That  definition  is 

restated  here  with  slight  modification:  An   “operator”   “must  manage,  direct,  or  conduct 

operations specifically related to pollution, that is, operations having to do with the leakage or 

disposal of [oil], or decisions about compliance with environmental regulations.”239  “Person  in  

charge”  carries  a  similar  definition.240 

537.  The  evidence  showed  that  BPXP  was  an  “operator”  and  a  “person  in  charge”  of  

the offshore facility (the Macondo well) for purposes of the CWA.  BP determined and directed 

all aspects of how the well would be designed and drilled, to what depth it would be drilled, the 

cementing process, and how and when temporary abandonment would take place.   

538.  The   evidence   similarly   showed   that   BPXP   was   an   “operator”   and   a   “person  in 

charge”  of  the  “vessel”  (the  DEEPWATER  HORIZON) for purposes of the CWA.  BPXP was, 

for  practical  purposes,  the  time  charterer  of  the  HORIZON.    BPXP  directed  the  HORIZON 

where  to  go  and  to  what  depth  it  would  drill.    Thus,  BPXP  directed  operations  specifically 

related  to  oil  pollution.   The  fact  that  the  BP  Well  Site  Leader  had  to  approve  the  sheen  test

before fluids could be discharged overboard, rather than stored onboard, is a specific example of 

BPXP making a decision about compliance with environmental laws.  Other examples abound, 

but this is sufficient to establish the point.   

539.  Accordingly, BPXP is liable under the CWA, even if it is later determined that the 

discharge  was  “from”  the  vessel  and  not  the  offshore  facility.241

Transocean  Deepwater  Inc.,  and  Transocean  Offshore  Deepwater  Drilling  Inc.,  but  not 

Transocean  Ltd.  or  Triton  Asset  Leasing  GmbH.    “Halliburton”   means   Halliburton   Energy  

Service,  Inc.  and  Halliburton’s  Sperry  division.    BP, Transocean, and Halliburton are sometimes 

referred  to  collectively  as  “Defendants.” 

542.  Based  on  the  Court’s   findings   and   as   further   explained   below,   the   Court  

concludes that each Defendant engaged in conduct that was negligent or worse and a legal cause 

of the blowout, explosion, and oil spill.   

543.  The   Court   further   finds   that   BP’s   conduct   was   reckless.      Transocean’s   conduct  

was  negligent.    Halliburton’s  conduct  was  also  negligent.     
                                                 

241  As  mentioned  above,  the  Court  previously  determined  on  summary  judgment  that  the  discharge  was  “from”  
the offshore facility for purposes  of  the  CWA,  and  that  BPXP  was  liable  as  an  “owner”  of  that  facility.    BP  and  
Anadarko  appealed  that  ruling,  arguing  that  the  discharge  was  “from”  the  vessel.    That  appeal  is  pending  at  the  time  
of this writing.  See supra note 161 and accompanying text.

544.  The  Court  further  concludes  that  the  comparative  fault  of  the  Defendants, 

expressed as a percentage of total liability, is as follows:  

BP:  

 

67% 

Transocean:   30% 

Halliburton:  3% 

545.  Finally, the Court finds that the conduct of BP’s  employees  was  egregious  enough  

that exemplary or  punitive damages would be  appropriate.   However,  in light of  Fifth Circuit 

precedent, the Court concludes that BP is not liable for punitive damages.  

Fault Allocation and Degree  

 
ii.
546.  The   usual   standard   for   stating   a   claim   in   negligence   is   that   “the   plaintiff   must  

demonstrate that there was a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, breach of that duty, 

injury sustained by the plaintiff, and a causal connection  between  the  defendant’s  conduct  and  

the   plaintiff’s   injury.”242    Given  the  phased  nature  of  these  proceedings,  the  Court  is  not 

concerned here with questions of duty or causation as they relate to the Plaintiffs (e.g., a onshore 

hotel that lost profits allegedly due to the oil spill).  Instead, the Court focuses on whether any 

Defendant  breached  the  applicable  standard  of  care,  the  nature  of  that  breach,  and  the  causal 

connection, if any, between that breach and the blowout, explosion, and oil spill. 

547.  As to causation, the negligence must be the “legal  cause” of the damage, which is 

something   more   than   “but   for”  causation—“the  negligence  must  be  a  substantial  factor  in 

causing   the   injuries.”243    If  more  than  one  party  is  the  legal  cause  of  the  harm,  liability  is 

apportioned  pursuant  to  comparative  fault.244    However,  “apportionment  is  not  a  mechanical 

                                                 

omitted).

exercise that depends upon counting up the errors committed by  [the] parties.  The trial court 
must determine, based upon the number and quality of faults by each party, the role each fault 

had  in  causing  the  [casualty].” 245   

548.  As   to   BP’s   conduct,   the  Court  incorporates  its  discussion  above  regarding  the 

CWA.246  For the reasons stated there, the Court finds  that  BP’s  conduct  was  “reckless”  under  

general maritime law and a substantial cause of the blowout, explosion, and oil spill.247   

549.  As  to  Transocean,  the  Court  has  identified  several  instances  where  Transocean’s  

conduct fell below the standard of care.  This  includes  the  drill  crew’s  misinterpretation of the 

negative  pressure  test,248  the   drill   crew’s   failure   to   detect   the   pressure   anomaly   between   9:08  

p.m. and 9:14 p.m.,249  the  drill  crew’s  failure  to  perform  a  flow  check  followed by immediately 

shutting  in  the  well  at  9:31  p.m.,250  the  drill  crew’s   failure   to   divert   flow   overboard,251  the 

master’s   failure   to   timely  activate  EDS,252  and   Transocean’s   failure   to   properly   maintain   the  

BOP.253   

550.  However, BP had a hand in most of these failures.   

551.  With  respect  to  the  misinterpretation  of  the  negative  pressure  test,  BP  was 

ultimately responsible for its interpretation, not Transocean.  It was  BP’s  decision  to  use  the  left-

over LCM as a spacer that caused the false reading on the kill line—a decision that was driven

by  its  desire  to  save  costs.    BP  instructed  the  Transocean  drill  crew  to  switch  the  negative 

pressure test from the  drill  crew’s  customary  method,  the drill pipe, to the kill line.  The Court 

agrees with the view expressed by, among others, BP’s expert Dr. Bourgoyne, that the negative 

pressure test would have been properly interpreted had the drill crew been permitted to continue 

the test on the drill pipe.254  Most importantly, the drill crew did not have the benefit of Mark 

Hafle’s  crucial  observation  about  pressure  anomalies,  as  did  Don Vidrine.   

552.  Turning  to  the  well  monitoring  and  control  issues,  BP’s   acceptance  of  the 

negative pressure test likely created a misperception on the rig that any well-related issues were 

securely  behind  cemented  pipe.    Thus,  the  misinterpretation  of  the  negative  pressure  test  (for 

which  BP  bears  most  of  the  blame)  contributed  to  the  subsequent  failures  respecting  well 

monitoring and control.  BP’s  decision  to  permit  simultaneous  operations  during  displacement 

also contributed to the well control failures.   

553.  Furthermore,  there  is  ample  evidence  that  the  drill  crew  was  attentive  and 

responsive to the well, such as when they reacted to the pressure spike at 9:17.255  Indeed, the 

drill  crew  noticed  and  reacted  to  the  pressure  anomaly  between  9:27  and  9:30;  while  their 

response was incorrect, it hardly reflects a conscious disregard for a known risk or an extreme 

departure from the standard of care.  The drill crew also  noticed  that  the  BOP’s  upper  annular  

was not sealing the well and activated the variable bore rams, upon which they likely believed 

they had succeeded in stopping the blowout.      

554.  Another  point  about  Transocean’s  well  control  failures  is  that  they  occurred  in  a 

relatively short time frame and in the context of a situation that escalated rapidly. The same can 

also  be  said  about  the  master’s  failure  to  timely EDS.  BP’s  misconduct,  by  contrast,  was  spread

over a longer time frame.  Thus, while Transocean had limited time to react properly, BP could 

consider its choices.   

555.  A related point is  that  BP’s failures up to and including the negative pressure test 

created  the  catastrophic  situation.    Transocean’s  failures,  by contrast, largely concern its inability 

(due in part to further failures by BP) to stop the catastrophe BP set in motion.     

556.  The Court also considers the proper actions taken by the marine crew following 

the explosions.256  BP’s  conduct,  by  contrast,  lacks  similar  balance.     

557.  For  these  reasons,  the  Court  concludes  that  Transocean’s  conduct  was  negligent  

and  that  Transocean’s  share  of  liability  is  considerably  less  than  BP’s.     

558.  As  to  Halliburton,  it  had  two  failures:  one  concerned  cement257  and  the  other 

concerned well monitoring.258  With  respect  to  the  former,  Halliburton’s  conduct  is  egregious.    

The Court refers not only to failures before the incident, but also to Halliburton’s  post-incident 

conduct involving  “off  the  side”  cement  tests  and destroyed computer simulations.  Nevertheless, 

because  the  Court  ultimately  finds  that  the  unstable  foamed  cement  was  not  a  cause  of  the 

blowout,  no  legal  fault  is  allocated  to  Halliburton  for  these  failures.      Halliburton’s   failure  

concerning well monitoring was relatively small when compared to others’ failures, and it was a 

failure shared by Transocean’s  drill  crew.     

559.  Accordingly,  to  the  extent  claims  against  Halliburton  were  based  on  a  strict 

products  liability  theory  under  maritime  law,  those  claims  fail  in  light  of  the  finding  that  the 

cement, however defective, was not a cause of the blowout.  This does not affect claims against 

Halliburton that sound in negligence, however.

560.  The  Court   concludes   that   Halliburton’s   conduct   was   negligent   and   that  

Halliburton’s  share  of  liability  is  considerably  less  than  both  Transocean  and  BP.     

Liability for Punitive Damages: Fifth Circuit Rule 

 
iii.
561.  Punitive  damages  may  be  imposed  under  general  maritime  law  for  reckless, 

willful, and wanton conduct.259   

562.  Under  the  facts  of  this  case,  the  Court  finds  that  the  conduct  exhibited  by  BP’s  

employees would make an award of punitive damages appropriate.   

563.  However, the maritime rule in the Fifth Circuit is that operational recklessness or 

willful disregard is generally insufficient to visit punitive damages upon the employer.  Rather, 

the conduct must emanate from corporate policy or that a corporate official with policy-making 

authority participated in, approved of, or subsequently ratified the egregious conduct.260 

564.  The PSC argues that the instant matter should be distinguished from P&E Boat, as 

that case involved essentially a routine transit by a 46’  crewboat to a drilling platform, albeit in 

heavy  fog.    The  crewboat’s  operation  was  only  a  narrow  function  within  the  overall scheme of 

the defendant,  Chevron’s,  business  activities.    The  HORIZON/Macondo well, by contrast, was a 

significant and substantial operation, requiring the full commitments and attentions of BP and its 

contractors.  Thus, irrespective of the extent to which various participants might or might not be 

classified  as  “official  policymakers,”  this  was  not  a  situation  where  a  rogue  employee  decided,  

on his own, to engage in reckless conduct.  

565.  The  PSC’s  argument  is  not  without  merit.    The various BP entities are organized 

by function.  The function of BP Exploration & Production, Inc., as its name suggests, was to 

explore for and produce oil.  Drilling an offshore well like Macondo, then, is at the very heart of

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 141 of 153

BPXP’s  purpose.    And  as the PSC points out, a substantial amount of resources was devoted to 

Macondo:    It  involved  extensive  pre-operation  planning,  significant  financial  commitments,  a 

massive  drilling  vessel  with  sophisticated  equipment,  and  teams  of  onshore  and  offshore 

personnel.  Despite  the  geographic  distance  between  Macondo  and  BP’s  Houston  office,  BP’s  

onshore engineers, geologists, and operational supervisors were tightly connected with the well, 

BP’s  offshore  personnel,  and  BP’s  contractors.    Data from the well was transmitted in real time 

directly to BP’s  Houston office.  BP’s  onshore  personnel  communicated  frequently  with  those  on  

the  HORIZON,  and  many  decisions,  including  operational  decisions,  were  made  in  BP’s  

Houston office.261  Furthermore, the interpretation of the negative pressure test was a particularly 

critical moment for the Macondo operation.  In light of all this, the Court agrees with the PSC 
that the facts of this case present a different scenario from P&E Boat.  The Court similarly agrees 

that imputing the reckless acts of BP’s  Well Site Leader and onshore engineer to BP would not 
appear to conflict with the rationale behind P&E Boat—that a corporation should be liable for 

punitive damages only when the corporation is itself the wrongdoer262—given that BP entrusted 
these employees with such a critical part of a massive operation.  Ultimately, some person within 

BP had to determine the outcome of the negative pressure test.  Who that person is should have 

little legal significance.  The pressurized hydrocarbons presumably do not react differently when 

a corporate executive, as opposed to a Well Site Leader, misinterprets the negative pressure test.  

Under the circumstances,  BP  should  be  viewed  as  the  “wrongdoer.”   

566.  Nevertheless,  P&E  Boat  does  not  appear  to  leave  room  for  this  interpretation.   

Moreover, the Court finds that Vidrine and Hafle were not policy-making officials, nor did the 

                                                 

261 For example, John Guide, the Wells Team Leader in Houston, made the decision to proceed with the cement 
job following the issues with the float collar, to run the production casing with only 6 centralizers instead of 21, and 
to forego the CBL.  Sometimes he made these decisions after discussing the issue with others.  Sometimes, he made 
these decisions more or less on his own.

reckless conduct emanate from corporate policy.  It also does not appear that BPXP recklessly 
hired its employees, which P&E Boat suggests may be another ground for punitive liability.263 

567.  Accordingly,  the  Court  concludes  that  BP  cannot  be  held  liable  for  punitive 

damages under general maritime law.264 265  

iv.

Liability for Punitive Damages: Other Circuits 

 
568.  The  State  of  Alabama  urges  the  Court  to  make  separate  findings,  as  not  all 
Circuits  follow  the  same  rule  as  the  Fifth  Circuit  and  some  cases  may  ultimately  be  resolved 

under the law of other Circuits.266   

569.  The Court will briefly indulge this request.   

570.  The  Ninth  Circuit’s  maritime  rule  follows the Restatement, which allows punitive 

damages   against   the   corporate   entity   when   the   actor   was   in   a   “managerial   capacity”   and  

performing within the scope of his employment.267  The Court finds that Vidrine and Hafle were 

in  a  “managerial  capacity”  and their actions arose within the scope of their employment.   

571.  The  First  Circuit  appears  to  also  use  the  managerial  agent  theory,  but  with  the 

added requirement that there  be   “some  level  of   [corporate]  culpability   for  the  misconduct.”268  

The Court finds that punitive liability would attach to BPXP under this standard as well.   

                                                 

263  Id. at 652 (quoting U.S. Steel Corp. v. Fuhrman, 407 F.2d 1142, 1148 (6th Cir. 1969)).  
264  The Court further notes that, even if BP were liable for punitive damages, only commercial fishermen or 
those  who  could  satisfy  the  “physical  injury”  threshold  of  the  Robins Dry Dock rule would be entitled to such an 
award.   
265  While  this  matter  was  under   advisement,   BP   brought   to   the   Court’s   attention   the   Fifth   Circuit’s   recent  
decision in United States v. American Commercial Lines, LLC, No. 13-30358, 2014 WL 3511882 (5th Cir. July 16, 
2014),  which  BP  asserts  is  relevant  to  the  issue  of  whether  OPA  displaces  the  general  maritime  law  remedy  of 
punitive damages.  The PSC indicated it interpreted the case differently.  Regardless, given the conclusion that BP is 
not liable for punitive damages under P&E Boats, the Court sees little reason to invite another round of briefing or 
otherwise address this case or the issue of displacement. 
266 As mentioned earlier, the Supreme Court could not resolve this issue when it was presented in Baker, 554 
267 Protectus Alpha Nav. Co., Ltd. V. N. Pac. Grain Growers, Inc., 767 F.2d 1379, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1985).

the parent corporation of the other Transocean defendants.

Ltd. are not liable under general maritime law.   

vi.

Triton Asset Leasing GmbH 

 
574.  After  the  Phase  One  trial  concluded,   Triton   Asset   Leasing   GmbH   (“Triton”)  

moved for judgment on partial findings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(c).269  The PSC 

filed an opposition.270  The Court has deferred ruling on that motion until now.   

575.  Triton  Asset  Leasing  GmbH  (“Triton”)  was  the  owner  of  the  HORZION.     

576.  On  August  17,  2001,  nearly   nine   years   before   the   Macondo   blowout,   Triton’s  

predecessor chartered the HORIZON to the predecessor of Transocean Holdings LLC.   

577.  Triton and the PSC agree that the charter party between Triton and Transocean 

Holdings LLC was a bareboat charter.     

578.  Triton and the PSC also agree that an owner is not responsible for negligence or 

unseaworthy conditions that arise after a bareboat or demise charter commences.271     

579.  Triton contends that it is entitled to judgment exonerating it from liability because 

Plaintiffs have not shown any negligence or unseaworthy condition existing prior to the bareboat 

charter that caused the blowout, explosion, and oil spill.   

580.  The PSC  contends  that  the  HORIZON  was  unseaworthy,  as  a  result  of  Triton’s  

negligence, before the vessel was bareboat chartered to Transocean Holdings  LLC.   The PSC 

bases its argument on the configuration of the HORIZON’s  BOP.  It claims that (1) the BOP 
                                                 

269 Rec. Doc. 10465.      
270 Rec. Doc. 10709.  Although this discussion refers only to Triton and the PSC, the Court has considered the 
271 See Picou v. D & L Towing, Inc., No. 09-2810, 2010 WL 2696468, at *3 (E.D. La. July 6, 2010). 

arguments  of  the  other  Phase  One  parties  to  the  extent  they  are  relevant  to  Triton’s  motion. 

 

143 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 144 of 153

contained only one set of shearing rams capable of sealing the well, upon which all emergency 

functions relied, which created a created a single point of failure; (2) the BOP failed to utilize 

design alternatives that would account for off-center drill pipe, such as the DVS (Double  “V”  

Shear) rams;;  (3)  the  BOP’s  redundant  control  (MUX)  cables  were  routed  through  the  moon  pool, 

which permitted a single explosion to destroy both cables; (4) the BOP did not utilize an acoustic 

trigger, which would have provided a backup control to the MUX cables; and (5) the BOP was 

not capable of containing a well with high flow capacity.   Thus, the PSC concludes that the BOP 

was  never  fit  for  its  intended  purpose,  and  rendered  the  vessel  unseaworthy  from  the  time  it 

entered service in April 2001.   

581.  As  mentioned  in  Part  III.J.vii,  the  Court  has  rejected  these  arguments.  

Accordingly, the Court agrees with Triton that the negligence and unseaworthiness that caused or 

contributed to the events of April 20, 2010, arose after the bareboat charter commenced.   

582.  For these reasons, Triton is not liable under general maritime law for the blowout, 

explosion,  and  oil  spill.    Triton’s  Rule  52(c)  Motion  is  GRANTED.272   
D. 

Contractual Releases and Indemnities 
583.  The Court had previously indicated that grossly negligent conduct by Transocean 

or Halliburton would invalidate the release (but not an indemnity) contained in their respective 

contracts with BP.273   

                                                 

272  To  be  clear,  this  finding  applies  to  claims  under  general  maritime  law.    A  vessel  owner  who  bareboat 
charters  its  vessel  could  still  be  held  liable  under  a  statute  like  OPA  or  the  CWA,  which  imposes  liability 
irrespective  of  fault.    However,  under  the  Court’s  previous  decisions  in  this  case,  it  appears  Triton   would  not  be  
liable  under  the   CWA  (because  the  discharge   was  not   “from”  Triton’s  vessel,   nor  could  Triton  be  considered  an  
“operator”  of  the  offshore  facility).    See Order and Reasons [As to the Cross-Motions for Partial Summary Judgment 
Regarding Liability under the CWA and OPA] Rec. Doc. 5809, 844 F. Supp. 2d 746 (E.D. La. Feb. 22, 2012).  The 
only liability Triton appears to face under OPA would be for a surface, as opposed to a subsurface, discharge.   See 
id.  The parties have agreed to defer the issue of whether any surface discharge occurred, however.

584.  The Court also previously indicated that certain types of breaches or fraud might 

invalidate contractual indemnities and releases.274   

585. 

In  light  of  the  conclusions  above,  the  Court  finds   that   Transocean’s   and  

Halliburton’s  contractual  indemnities and releases are valid and enforceable against BP.   
E. 

Limitation of Liability 
586.  For  purposes  of  this  discussion  regarding  the  Limitation  of  Liability  Act, 

“Transocean”   means   Transocean  Holdings  LLC,  Transocean  Deepwater  Inc.,  and  Transocean 

Offshore Deepwater Drilling Inc., but not Transocean Ltd. or Triton Asset Leasing GmbH. 

587.  The Limitation of Liability Act generally  limits  a  vessel  owner’s  liability  to  the  

value of the vessel, post casualty, plus any pending freight.275  The limit is removed, however, if 

the  negligence  or  unseaworthiness  that  caused  the  damage  was  within  the  “privity  or knowledge”  

of the owner.276   

588. 

In the typical case, claimants bear the initial burden of proving that their injuries 

arose as a result  of  the  owner’s  negligence  or  the  vessel’s  unseaworthiness.    Once this burden is 

met,  the  burden  shifts  to  the  owner  to  prove  a  lack  of  “privity  or  knowledge”  of  a  negligent  act  or  

unseaworthy condition.277   

589. 

“‘Privity  or  knowledge’  implies  some  sort  of  ‘complicity  in  the  fault  that  caused  

the  accident.”278  “Knowledge,  when  the  shipowner  is  a  corporation,  is  judged  not  only  by  what  

the   corporation’s   managing   officers   actually   knew,   but   also   by   what   they   should   have   known  

with respect to conditions  or  actions  likely  to  cause  the  loss.”279

590.  The Limitation Act does not apply to all claims, however.  Notably, it does not 

apply to oil spill claims arising under OPA.280  

591.  The Court finds that the drill  crew’s  failure  to  divert  flow  overboard  constituted a 

proximate   cause   of   the   explosion,   fire,   and   oil   spill   that   was   within   Transocean’s   privity   and  

knowledge.281  To the extent this failure was negligence, Transocean was aware  that its crews 

lacked  training  about  the  proper  use  of  diverters,  and  therefore  this  negligence  was  within 

Transocean’s  privity  and  knowledge.      The  Court  also  finds  that  the  failure  to  line up the diverter 

to discharge overboard prior to the critical operation of displacing the well was also negligence 

within Transocean’s  privity  and  knowledge,  given  that  Transocean  (and  BP’s)  policy was to keep 

the  diverter  lined  up  to  the  MGS.    Additionally  and  in  the  alternative,  failing  to  line  up  the 

diverter   to   discharge   overboard   created   an   unseaworthy   condition   within   Transocean’s   privity  

and knowledge.   Alternatively, if Transocean wanted to keep the diverter lined up to the MGS as 

the default even during displacement, then it should have equipped the diverter to automatically 

divert overboard once the pressure in the MGS reached a certain limit.    Transocean’s  failure  to  

take this alternative measure also constitutes negligence and an unseaworthy condition within its 

privity and knowledge. 

592.  Transocean’s   maintenance   failures   respecting   the   BOP   constituted  negligence 

and/or  created  an  unseaworthy  condition  within  its  privity  and  knowledge.282    Although  the 

explosions would have still occurred even if AMF had activated the  BSRs,  the  fire’s  fuel  source  

would have been removed, making it likely that the rig would have been saved and the oil spill 

would not have occurred.  Also, some injuries that occurred after the initial explosions would 

likely have been avoided or lessened.

593.  Finally,  the  master’s  failure  to  timely  activate EDS constituted negligence within 

the privity and knowledge of Transocean.  Like the BOP, the explosions likely would have still 

occurred even if the master had activated EDS in a timely manner, but the rig probably would 

have been saved and the oil spill would have been avoided.  Also, some injuries that occurred 

after the initial explosions would likely have been avoided or lessened.   

594.  For  these  reasons,  the  Court  finds  that  “Transocean”—meaning  Transocean 

Holdings LLC, Transocean Deepwater Inc., and Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling Inc.—

is not entitled to limit its liability under the Limitation of Liability Act.  Limitation of liability is 

not at issue for Transocean Ltd. and Triton Asset Leasing GmbH.   
F. 

i.

Liability Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 
 
595.  The  Court  previously  held  on  summary  judgment  that  BPXP  is   a   “responsible  

BPXP and  OPA’s  Liability  Cap 

party”  under  OPA with respect to the subsurface discharge of oil.283  

596. 

In the same ruling, the Court  denied  the  United  States’  request  for  a  finding  that  

OPA’s   limits  of  liability  did  not  apply  based  on  the  alleged  violation  of  two  federal 

regulations.284  

597. 

 Although the point is perhaps moot with respect to BPXP, the Court believes it 

partially erred as to the latter ruling and corrects that mistake here.    

598.  OPA contains various liability caps for oil-spill related damages.285  These limits 

do not apply if

284  Id. at 12-14, 844 F. Supp. 2d at 755.  BPXP had previously waived the OPA liability cap, which made the 
ruling  unnecessary  as  to  it.    However,  the  Government’s  motion  for  summary  judgment  also  targeted  Anadarko,  a  
co-lessee, which had not waived  the  liability  cap.      BPXP  opposed  the  Government’s  motion  “to  ensure  that  BP  is  
not  unfairly  tainted  with  regulatory  violations  before  the  Phase  1  trial  even  begins.”    Id. at 12 n.17, 844 F. Supp. 2d

147 

Case 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS   Document 13355   Filed 09/04/14   Page 148 of 153

the incident was proximately caused by . . . the violation of an applicable Federal 
safety, construction, or operating regulation by the responsible party, an agent or 
employee  of  the  responsible  party,  or  a  person  acting  pursuant  to  a  contractual 
relationship with the responsible party . . . .286 
 
599.  The  Government’s   argument   was   based   in   part   on   30   C.F.R.   §   250.420(a)(2),  

which in 2010 stated:  “You  must  case  and  cement  all  wells.    .  .  .  Your  casing  and  cementing  

programs must: . . . Prevent the direct or indirect release of fluids from any stratum through the 

wellbore into offshore  waters.” 

600.  The Government had argued that it was undisputed that the cement pumped into 

the Macondo well did not prevent the release of fluids from the formation through the wellbore 

and into offshore waters, therefore the OPA limits did not apply.  The Court responded that the 

regulation  was  equivalent  to  a  regulatory  prohibition  on  oil  spills,  and  therefore  could  not  be 

relied  upon  to  lift  the  liability  cap  as   it   would   tend   to   circumvent   the   “proximate   cause”  

requirement in OPA.  

601.  The  Court  has  a  far  better  understanding  of  the  importance  of  cementing  in 

offshore wells than it did in  2012,  when  it  ruled  on  the  Government’s  motion.    Furthermore, the 

Court believes that  a  breach  of  30  C.F.R.  §  250.420(a)(2)  can  be  a  “proximate  cause[]”  of  an  

“incident”287  for  purposes  of  removing  OPA’s  liability  cap.  The  Court  further  finds  that  the 

cementing  program  at  Macondo  clearly  did  not  prevent  the  direct  or  indirect  release  of  fluids 

from a stratum, through the wellbore, and into offshore waters, and this failure was, in fact, a 

proximate cause of the incident.   

                                                                                                                                                             

285  See 33 U.S.C. § 2704.  
286  Id. § 2704(c)(1). 
287  OPA  defines  “incident”  as  “any  occurrence  or  series  of  occurrences  having  the  same  origin,  involving  one  
or more vessels, facilities, or any combination thereof, resulting in the discharge or substantial threat of discharge of 
oil.”    33  U.S.C. § 2701(14).

602.  Accordingly,  the  Court  REVERSES  IN  PART  its  prior  ruling  of  February  22, 

2012.288   

 
ii.
603. 

Transocean’s  Liability  as  an  “Operator”  of  an  “Outer  Continental  Shelf  facility” 

 The Court previously ruled that Transocean was not a “responsible  party”  with  

respect  to  the  subsurface  discharge  of  oil,  and  therefore  was  not  liable  for  removal  costs  and 

damages  under  OPA’s  general  liability  provision,  33  U.S.C.  §  2702.  However, that ruling also 

noted that Transocean might be liable under another provision in OPA, 33 U.S.C. § 2704(c)(3), 

which   makes   an   “owner   or   operator”   (as   opposed   to   a   “responsible   party”)   of   an   “Outer  

Continental Shelf (“OCS”)  facility”  liable  to  government  entities (as opposed to private parties) 

for  all  removal  costs  (as  opposed  to  damages),  without  limit,  when  oil  discharges  from  said 

facility.289   

604. 

  Section 2704(c)(3) is something of an anomaly  in OPA.  A party liable under 

Section  2704(c)(3)  must  pay  all  government  removal  costs,  without  limit,  even  though  OPA 

already  provides  that   a   “responsible   party”   of   an   “offshore  facility”—which  would  seem  to 

include OCS facilities—is liable for all removal costs to all parties, private and governmental.290  

The  only  way  Section   2704(c)(3)   avoids   total   redundancy   is   that   it   makes   the   “owner   or  

operator”   liable,   whereas   the   “responsible   party”   for   an   offshore   facility   is   the   “lessee   or  

permittee  of  the  area  in  which  the  facility  is  located.”291  Notably, most provisions in OPA affix 

liability  to   a   “responsible   party,”   which  then  carries  different  meanings  depending  on  the 

structure or vessel at issue.  Section 2704(c)(3) appears to be the only provision in OPA that does 

not follow this convention and instead affixes liability  directly  to  the  “owner  or  operator.”

605.  The  Court  believes  Section  2704(c)(3)  is  a  result  of  legislative  oversight.    As 

explained in the Conference Report, separate bills from the House and Senate were merged to 

create the enacted version of OPA.  The  House  used  “responsible  party”  throughout  its  bill to 

affix liability,  while  the  Senate  used  “owner  and  operator.”  Like  “responsible  party,”  however,  

the  Senate  provided  different  definitions  for  “owner  or  operator”  depending  on  the  context.  The 

final   version   of   OPA   adopted   the   House   practice   of   using   “responsible   party.”      However,   the 

Conferees inserted the portion of the Senate bill pertaining to OCS facilities as subsection (c)(3) 

of  2704.292    In  so  doing,  the  Conferees  failed  to  conform  the  Senate  language  to  the  House’s 

convention  of  using  “responsible  party,”  nor  did  they  adopt  the  Senate’s  definition  of  “owner  or  

operator,”   which   meant   “lessee  or  permittee  of  the  area”  in  the  case  of  an  OCS  facility.293  

Consequently, the result is that OPA, as written, circuitously defines  the  “owner  or  operator”  of  

an  OCS  facility  as  “any  person  owning  or  operating  such  facility.”294 

606.  Nevertheless, the statute is perhaps not so odd as to warrant a judicial re-writing.  

Indeed, Transocean appears to concede that the Court  should  construe  “operator”  under  Section  

2704(c)(3)  as  it  did  under  the  CWA.    Thus,  an   “operator”   “must   manage,   direct,   or   conduct  

operations specifically related to pollution, that is, operations having to do with the leakage or 

disposal  of  [oil],  or  decisions   about   compliance   with   environmental   regulations.”295    The 
Bestfoods Court added that “to  operate”  “meant something more than mere mechanical activation 

of  pumps  and  valves,  and  must  be  read  to  contemplate  ‘operation’  as  including  the  exercise of 

direction  over  the  facility’s  activities.”296 

                                                 

292  See H.R. Rep. No. 101-653, at 7 (1990) (Conf. Rep.), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 779, 785

607.  Transocean grabs onto the latter quote and contends that, as a contractor, it merely 

exercised mechanical control over the HORIZON, while BP ultimately controlled and directed 

all operations  at the Macondo well.     Transocean  also   invites  the  Court  to  interpret  “operator”  

here   in   light   of   that   term’s   meaning   under   the   MMS   regulations:   “the   person   the   lessee(s)  

designates  as  having  control  or  management  of  operations  on  the  leased  area  or  a  portion 

thereof.”297 

608.  The  Court  is  not  persuaded.    OPA  uses  “operator”   in  connection  with  vessels, 

onshore  facilities,  pipelines,  and  OCS  facilities  without  any  indication  that  the  term  carries  a 

different or specific meaning when used in the OCS facility context.298  Furthermore, while the 

Court  agrees  that  BP  ultimately  controlled  and  directed  all  operations  at  Macondo,  the  Court 

views  Transocean  as  more  than  one  who  merely  performed  “mechanical  activation  of  pumps  and  

valves.”      Instead,   Transocean   “conduct[ed]  operations  specifically  related  to  pollution,  that  is 

operations having to do with the leakage or disposal of [oil].”    For  example,  Transocean’s  drill  

crew did not need direction or approval from the BP Well Site Leader to activate the BOP and 

shut in the well.  And, as the Court has found, the failure to do so timely actually resulted in oil 

pollution from the offshore facility.   

609.  Accordingly,  the  Court  finds  that  “Transocean”  (meaning  Transocean  Holdings 

LLC,  Transocean  Deepwater  Inc.,  and  Transocean  Offshore  Deepwater  Drilling  Inc.,  but  not 

Transocean Ltd. or Triton Asset Leasing GmbH.) was  an  “operator”  under  33  U.S.C.  §  2704(c).    

The  Court  notes,  however,  that  Transocean’s  liability  to  government  entities  for  removal  costs  is  

ultimately shifted to BP by virtue of the contractual indemnity.

V. 

SUMMARY  

610.  The  Court’s  conclusions relative to the Phase One trial are summarized below: 

611.  BP  Exploration   &   Production,   Inc.   (“BPXP”)   is  subject  to  enhanced  civil 

penalties under the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), 33 U.S.C. § 1321(b)(7)(D), as the discharge of 

oil was the result of BPXP’s  gross  negligence  and  BPXP’s  willful misconduct.299 

612.  BP  (meaning  BPXP  and  BP  America  Production  Company,  but  not  BP  p.l.c.), 

Transocean (meaning  Transocean Holdings  LLC, Transocean Deepwater  Inc., and Transocean 

Offshore Deepwater Drilling Inc., but not Transocean Ltd. or Triton Asset Leasing GmbH) and 

Halliburton   (meaning   Halliburton   Energy   Service,   Inc.   and   Halliburton’s   Sperry   division)   are  

each liable under general maritime law for the blowout, explosion, and oil  spill.    BP’s  conduct  

was  reckless.    Transocean’s  conduct  was  negligent.    Halliburton’s  conduct  was  negligent.    Fault 

is apportioned as follows:  

BP:  

 

67% 

Transocean:   30% 

Halliburton:  3% 

613.  Although  BP’s  conduct  warrants the imposition punitive damages under general 

 

maritime law, BP cannot be held liable for such damages under Fifth Circuit precedent.300   

614.  BP p.l.c., Transocean Ltd., and Triton Asset Leasing GmbH are not liable under 

general  maritime  law.    Triton  Asset  Leasing  GmbH’s  Rule  52(c)  Motion  for  Judgment on Partial 

Findings301 is GRANTED.  

                                                 

299  This   finding   is   premised   on   the   Court’s   previous   conclusion   that   oil   discharged   “from”   BPXP’s   offshore  
facility  for purposes of the  CWA.   Should it be determined on appeal that the  discharge   was  instead   “from”  the  
vessel, the Court further finds that BPXP was an operator and person in charge of the vessel.   

300 To the extent the standards of the First Circuit or Ninth Circuit would apply to a particular claim, the Court 

finds that BP would be liable for punitive damages under those rules.

615.  Transocean’s  and  Halliburton’s  indemnity  and  release  clauses  in  their  respective  

contracts with BP are valid and enforceable against BP.   

616.  Transocean Holdings LLC, Transocean Deepwater Inc., and Transocean Offshore 

Deepwater Drilling Inc. are not entitled to limit liability under the Limitation of Liability Act. 

617.  A violation of 30 C.F.R. § 250.420(a)(2) can  remove  OPA’s  liability  cap.    The  

Court’s  prior  holding  to  the  contrary  is  REVERSED.302   

618.  Transocean (meaning Transocean Holdings LLC, Transocean Deepwater Inc., and 

Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling Inc., but not Transocean Ltd. or Triton Asset Leasing 

GmbH)  was  an  “operator”  of  an  “Outer Continental Shelf facility” under the Oil Pollution Act of 

1990, 33 U.S.C. § 2704(c).  Consequently, Transocean is liable to the United States for removal 

costs.
